I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak’st.	I have half a mind to hit you before you speak again.
Yet if thou say Antony lives, is well, Or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him, I’ll set thee in a shower of gold and hail Rich pearls upon thee.	But if Antony is alive, healthy, friendly with Caesar, and not Caesar’s prisoner, I’ll shower you with gold and pearls.

But yet, madam— I do not like “But yet.” It does allay The good precedence.	But yet, madam— I don’t like the sound of “but yet.” It reverses all the good that came before it.
Fie upon “But yet.” “But yet” is as a jailer to bring forth Some monstrous malefactor.	Damn those words, “but yet!” “But yet” is like a jailer about to bring out some horrible criminal.
Prithee, friend, Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear, The good and bad together.	Please, my friend, give me all the news, both good and bad, at the same time.
He’s friends with Caesar, In state of health, thou say’st, and, thou say’st, free.	You say he’s friendly with Caesar, healthy, and free.

Thou shalt be whipped with wire and stewed in brine, Smarting in ling’ring pickle!	I’ll have you whipped with wire and soaked in brine like a pickle, making your pain linger.
Say ’tis not so, a province I will give thee And make thy fortunes proud.	If you say it isn’t true, I’ll give you a province and make you rich.
The blow thou hadst Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage, And I will boot thee with what gift beside Thy modesty can beg.	The blows I gave you already will make up for your upsetting me.
He’s married, madam.	He’s married, madam.
Rogue, thou hast lived too long.	Rogue, you’ve lived too long!
Nay then, I’ll run.	No way, then, I’ll run.
What mean you, madam?	What’s the matter with you, madam?
I have made no fault.	I haven’t done anything to you.
Good madam, keep yourself within yourself.	Good madam, restrain yourself.
The man is innocent.	The man hasn’t done anything wrong.
Some innocents ’scape not the thunderbolt.	Even innocents cannot always escape disaster.
Melt Egypt into Nile, and kindly creatures Turn all to serpents.	May Egypt drown in the Nile and all good creatures turn into poisonous snakes.
Call the slave again.	Call that servant back.
Though I am mad, I will not bite him.	Even though I’m mad, I won’t bite him.
Call!	Call him!
He is afeard to come.	He’s afraid to come in.
I will not hurt him.	I won’t hurt him.
These hands do lack nobility that they strike A meaner than myself, since I myself Have given myself the cause.	My hands are tainted if they hit an inferior, especially since I myself am the cause of my own distress.
Come hither, sir.	Come here, sir.
Though it be honest, it is never good To bring bad news.	It may be honest, but it’s never wise to bring bad news.
Give to a gracious message An host of tongues, but let ill tidings tell Themselves when they be felt.	You can give good news in many ways, but let bad news interpret itself as you tell it.
I have done my duty.	I’ve only done my duty.
Is he married?	Is he married?
The gods confound thee!	May the gods destroy you!
Dost thou hold there still?	Do you maintain the same story?
Should I lie, madam?	Do you want me to lie, madam?
Go, get thee hence.	Go, get out!
I crave your highness’ pardon.	Even if you were as handsome as  I beg your highness’ pardon.
He is married?	Is he really married?
Take no offense that I would not offend you.	Please don’t be offended that I don’t want to offend you any more.
To punish me for what you make me do Seems much unequal.	It’s not fair to punish me for something you make me do.
He’s married to Octavia.	He’s married to Octavia.
Oh, that his fault should make a knave of thee, That art not what th’ art sure of!	It’s too bad that Antony’s fault should make you look like a jerk.
Get thee hence.	Go away.
The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome Are all too dear for me.	The merchandise you bring from Rome is too expensive for me.
Lie they upon thy hand And be undone by ’em!	Let it stay in your inventory until it bankrupts you.
Good your highness, patience.	Be patient, your highness.
In praising Antony, I have dispraised Caesar.	When I have praised Antony, I’ve disparaged Caesar.
Many times, madam.	Many times, madam.
I am paid for ’t now.	I’m being repaid for that now.
Lead me from hence.	Help me out of here.

Let him not leave out The color of her hair.	Don’t let him leave out the color of her hair.
Bring me word how tall she is.	Bring me his answers quickly.

Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most anything Alexas, almost most absolute Alexas, where’s the soothsayer that you praised so to th’ Queen?	Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most anything Alexas, almost the most consummate Alexas, where’s the fortuneteller you recommended so highly to the Queen?
Oh that I knew this husband, which, you say, must charge his horns with garlands!	Oh, I only wish I knew the name of that husband you said he predicted will have a cheating wife!
I make not, but foresee.	I don’t make fortunes; I only see them.
Pray, then, foresee me one.	Then see a good one for me.

Wrinkles forbid!	May my wrinkles forbid that!
Vex not his prescience.	Don’t joke about his predictions.
Be attentive.	Pay attention.

Most meet That first we come to words, and therefore have we Our written purposes before us sent, Which, if thou hast considered, let us know If ’twill tie up thy discontented sword And carry back to Sicily much tall youth That else must perish here.	It’s proper that we speak first, which is why we sent our proposals ahead of us for your consideration.
What was ’t That moved pale Cassius to conspire?	Why did Cassius conspire against Caesar?
Take your time.	Take your time.
Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails.	Pompey, you cannot frighten us with your navy.
We’ll speak with thee at sea.	We’ll meet you at sea.
At land, thou know’st How much we do o’ercount thee.	Yes, on land you do outnumber me.
At land indeed Thou dost o’ercount me of my father’s house, But since the cuckoo builds not for himself, Remain in ’t as thou mayst.	Even more since you annexed my father’s house and lands.
Be pleased to tell us— For this is from the present—how you take The offers we have sent you.	But since,  To get back to the matter at hand, what do you think of our proposal?
There’s the point.	That’s the point.
Which do not be entreated to, but weigh What it is worth embraced.	Don’t let us talk you into anything, but consider carefully the value of our offers.
You have made me offer Of Sicily, Sardinia.	You have offered me the lands of Sicily and Sardinia.
And I must Rid all the sea of pirates, then, to send Measures of wheat to Rome.	In return, I must clear the sea of pirates and send tributes of wheat to Rome.
This ’greed upon To part with unhacked edges and bear back Our targes undinted.	If I agree to this, we may leave unharmed, with our shields undented.
That’s our offer.	That’s our offer.
Know then I came before you here a man prepared To take this offer, but Mark Antony Put me to some impatience.	You should know that when I came here I was prepared to accept your offer.
Let me have your hand.	Let me shake your hand.
I did not think, sir, to have met you here.	I didn’t think I would see you here.
The beds i’ th’ East are soft, and thanks to you, That called me timelier than my purpose hither, For I have gained by ’t.	The East is very seductive.
Well, I know not What counts harsh Fortune casts upon my face, But in my bosom shall she never come To make my heart her vassal.	Well, I cannot tell how my difficult life has weathered my face, but I will never let those difficulties subdue my courage.
Well met here.	It’s good we had this meeting.
I hope so, Lepidus.	I hope it works out for the best, Lepidus.
Thus we are agreed.	So we are in agreement.
That’s the next to do.	That’s the next thing on the agenda.
We’ll feast each other ere we part, and let’s Draw lots who shall begin.	We’ll have celebration feasts for each other before we go our separate ways.
That will I, Pompey.	I’ll give the first one, Pompey.
No, Antony, take the lot.	No, Antony.
But, first or last, Your fine Egyptian cookery shall have The fame.	Whether your banquet is first or last, your Egyptian cooking will make it the best.
I have heard that Julius Caesar Grew fat with feasting there.	I heard that Julius Caesar got fat from all the feasting there.
You have heard much.	You’ve heard a lot.
I have fair meanings, sir.	I mean well, sir.
And fair words to them.	I’m sure you do.
Then so much have I heard.	I’ve heard a lot more.
And I have heard Apollodorus carried—                                                                               What, I pray you?	I heard that Apollodorus carried—   What did he carry, please?
How far’st thou, soldier?	How are you, soldier?
Well, And well am like to do, for I perceive, Four feasts are toward.	I’m well, and probably will be for a while, as I hear that four feasts are being prepared.
Let me shake thy hand.	Let me shake your hand.
I never hated thee.	I’ve never been your enemy.
I have seen thee fight When I have envied thy behavior.	I’ve seen you fight and envied your skill.
Sir, I never loved you much, but I ha’ praised ye When you have well deserved ten times as much As I have said you did.	Sir, I wouldn’t say I was your friend, but I’ve praised you when you deserved ten times more praise than I gave.
Enjoy thy plainness.	Enjoy your frankness; it suits you.
It nothing ill becomes thee.— Aboard my galley I invite you all.	I invite you all aboard my ship.
Will you lead, lords?	After you, my lords?
Show ’s the way, sir.	Show us the way, sir.
Come.	Come with me.
At sea, I think.	I think it was at sea.
We have, sir.	That it was, sir.
You have done well by water.	You’ve done well at sea.
And you by land.	And you’ve done well on land.
I will praise any man that will praise me, though it cannot be denied what I have done by land.	I’ll flatter anyone who flatters me—though what I’ve accomplished on land cannot be denied.
Nor what I have done by water.	Neither can my accomplishments at sea.
Yes, something you can deny for your own safety: you have been a great thief by sea.	Yes, for your own safety, you should deny one thing: you have been a great thief at sea.
And you by land.	As you were on land.
There I deny my land service.	That’s the one part of my service on land I do deny.
But give me your hand, Menas.	But let’s shake hands, Menas.
If our eyes had authority, here they might take two thieves kissing.	If our eyes were policemen, they might capture two thieves at once while we’re embracing.
All men’s faces are true, whatsome’er their hands are.	Men’s faces are truthful, whatever their hands do.
But there is never a fair woman has a true face.	But no beautiful woman has an honest face.
No slander.	That’s no lie.
They steal hearts.	They steal hearts.
We came hither to fight with you.	We came here to fight against you.
For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking.	For my part, I’m sorry this battle turned into a drinking match.
Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.	Today Pompey laughs away his fortune.
If he do, sure he cannot weep ’t back again.	If that’s true, he won’t get it back by crying.
You’ve said, sir.	That’s the truth, sir.
We looked not for Mark Antony here.	We didn’t expect Mark Antony to be here.
Pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?	Is he married to Cleopatra?
Caesar’s sister is called Octavia.	Caesar’s sister is named Octavia.
True, sir.	That’s true, sir.
She was the wife of Caius Marcellus.	She was previously Caius Marcellus’ wife.
But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.	But she is now Mark Antony’s wife.
Pray ye, sir?	Excuse me, sir?
Tis true.	It’s true.
Then is Caesar and he forever knit together.	Then Caesar and he will always be united.
If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not prophesy so.	If I were to make a prediction regarding this union, I wouldn’t say that.
I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties.	I think the marriage was made more for political reasons than for love.
I think so too.	I think so too.
But you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity.	But you’ll see that the very thing that joins them will be the thing that separates them.
Octavia is of a holy, cold, and still conversation.	Octavia has a pious, chaste, meek disposition.
Who would not have his wife so?	Doesn’t everyone want a wife like that?
Not he that himself is not so, which is Mark Antony.	Not someone who doesn’t share that disposition, meaning Mark Antony.
He will to his Egyptian dish again.	He’ll go back to his Egyptian dish.
Then shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar, and, as I said before, that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance.	Then Octavia’s complaints will rouse Caesar, and as I said before, the thing that brought them together will part them.
Antony will use his affection where it is.	Antony will go where his passion is.
He married but his occasion here.	He only married out of political necessity.
And thus it may be.	Then that’s the way it may turn out.
Come, sir, will you aboard?	Come on, sir, will you come aboard?
I have a health for you.	I want to drink your health.
I shall take it, sir.	I’ll join you, sir.
We have used our throats in Egypt.	We did a lot of drinking in Egypt.
Come, let’s away.	Let’s go.
Here they’ll be, man.	Here’s where they’ll end up, on the floor.
Some o’ their plants are ill-rooted already.	Some of them are leaning already.
Lepidus is high-colored.	Lepidus is red in the face.
They have made him drink alms-drink.	They made him drink the leftover wine usually given to the poor.
I had as lief have a reed that will do me no service as a partisan I could not heave.	I’d rather carry a reed that obviously can’t protect me than a sword I cannot lift.
Thus do they, sir: they take the flow o’ th’ Nile By certain scales i’ th’ Pyramid.	This is how they do it, sir: they measure the depth of the Nile, according to certain marks made on the walls of the Pyramid.
They know By th’ height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth Or foison follow.	They know by those measurements if there will be famine or plenty.
The higher Nilus swells The more it promises.	The higher the Nile flows, the better the harvest.
As it ebbs, the seedsman Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain, And shortly comes to harvest.	The harvest comes shortly after that.
You’ve strange serpents there?	Do you have unusual snakes there?
Ay, Lepidus.	Yes, Lepidus.
Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the operation of your sun.	The Egyptian snake is born when the sun shines on the Nile mud, just like the crocodile.
I am not so well as I should be, but I’ll ne’er out.	I don’t feel so well, but I won’t stop.
Not till you have slept.	Not until you pass out.
I fear me you’ll be in till then.	I’m afraid you’ll keep going until then.
Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies’ pyramises are very goodly things.	I’ve heard that the pyramids build by the Ptolemies are splendid.
Without contradiction I have heard that.	Without doubt I’ve heard that.
What manner o’ thing is your crocodile?	What does a crocodile look like?
It is shaped, sir, like itself, and it is as broad as it hath breadth.	Sir, it’s shaped like itself and is as wide as it has width.
It is just so high as it is, and moves with its own organs.	It is only as high as it is and moves with its own legs.
Of it own color too.	Its own color.
Tis a strange serpent.	It’s a strange snake.
Tis so.	It is that.
And the tears of it are wet.	And its tears are wet.
The matter?	What is it?
I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.	I’ve always had great respect for your destiny.
Thou hast served me with much faith.	You’ve served me faithfully.
What’s else to say?—                                                          These quicksands, Lepidus, Keep off them, for you sink.	What else can I say?
What sayst thou?	What are you saying?
Wilt thou be lord of the whole world?	Would you like to be king of the entire world?
That’s twice.	Now I’ve said it twice.
How should that be?	How could that happen?
Nay, hear him.	Just listen to him.
Good now, some excellent fortune!	Be kind now and tell me some excellent fortune.
Let me be married to three kings in a forenoon and widow them all.	Tell me that I’ll marry three kings before noon and be widowed by all of them.
Oh, excellent!	Oh, excellent!
Then belike my children shall have no names.	Then my children will probably be illegitimate.
Prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?	Tell me, please: how many boys and girls will I have?
If every of your wishes had a womb, And fertile every wish, a million.	If every time you wished for a child you could have had one, you would have a million children.
You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.	You seem to think no one outside of your bedroom knows what you wish.
We’ll know all our fortunes.	We’ll all want our fortune told.
Mine, and most of our fortunes tonight, shall be—drunk to bed.	My fortune—like that of many of us tonight—is to go drunk to bed.
Hast thou drunk well?	Are you drunk?
No, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.	No, Pompey, I haven’t had anything to drink.
Show me which way.	Tell me how.
These three world-sharers, these competitors, Are in thy vessel.	The three who share the known world are aboard your boat.
All there is thine.	Everything that belongs to them is yours.
Ah, this thou shouldst have done And not have spoke on ’t!	Oh, you should have done it without telling me!
In me ’tis villainy, In thee ’t had been good service.	For you to do it would be good service.
Thou must know, ’Tis not my profit that does lead mine honor; Mine honor, it.	You should know that to me, profit isn’t more important than honor, but the other way around.
Repent that e’er thy tongue Hath so betrayed thine act.	Regret that your mouth betrayed your actions.
Being done unknown, I should have found it afterwards well done, But must condemn it now.	But now I must condemn it.
Desist, and drink.	Give it up and go drink.
This health to Lepidus!	This toast is for Lepidus!
Here’s to thee, Menas!	Here’s to you, Menas.
Enobarbus, welcome.	I accept with thanks, Enobarbus.
There’s a strong fellow, Menas.	There goes a strong fellow, Menas.
Why?	Why do you say that?
He bears The third part of the world, man.	He carries a third of the world.
Seest not?	Can’t you see that?
The third part, then, is drunk.	Then a third of the world is drunk.
Drink thou.	Drink up.
Come.	All right, then.
This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.	This hasn’t reached the level of an Egyptian feast yet.
It ripens towards it.	It’s getting there.
Strike the vessels, ho!	Clink your cups together in a toast!
Here’s to Caesar.	Here’s to Caesar.
I could well forbear ’t.	I could do without another toast.
Be a child o’ th’ time.	Live in the moment.
But I had rather fast from all four days Than drink so much in one.	But I would rather abstain from everything for four days than drink so much in one.
Let’s ha ’t, good soldier.	Let’s have one, good soldier.
Come, let’s all take hands Till that the conquering wine hath steeped our sense In soft and delicate Lethe.	Come, let’s join our hands until the overpowering wine makes us soft and forgetful.
All take hands.	Everyone join hands.
What needs more words?	How can you top that?
Good night.	Good night, Pompey.
And shall, sir.	Yes, we will.
Give ’s your hand.	Let’s shake on it.
We are friends.	We’re friends!

For learn this, Silius: Better to leave undone than by our deed Acquire too high a fame when him we serve’s away.	You must understand, Silius, that it’s better to leave something undone than achieve too much fame in your superior’s absence.
Caesar and Antony have ever won More in their officer than person.	Caesar and Antony have always achieved more by delegating authority to their officers than by leading their troops in person.
Who does i’ th’ wars more than his captain can Becomes his captain’s captain; and ambition, The soldier’s virtue, rather makes choice of loss Than gain which darkens him.	A man who achieves more in war than his captain does becomes his captain’s rival.
I could do more to do Antonius good, But ’twould offend him, and in his offense Should my performance perish.	I could do more to help Antony, but to do so would insult him.
Thou hast, Ventidius, that Without the which a soldier and his sword Grants scarce distinction.	A soldier is just a tool, like his sword, unless he has your qualities, Ventidius.
Thou wilt write to Antony?	Are you going to write Antony about this?
I’ll humbly signify what in his name, That magical word of war, we have effected: How with his banners and his well-paid ranks The ne’er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia We have jaded out o’ th’ field.	I’ll write how, under his flag and with his well-paid troops, we have beaten the formerly unvanquished Parthia.
Where is he now?	Where’s Antony now?
What, are the brothers parted?	Did the brothers-in-law leave?
They have dispatched with Pompey; he is gone.	They finished their business with Pompey, and Pompey has left.
Octavia weeps To part from Rome.	Octavia weeps at the thought of leaving Rome.
Caesar is sad, and Lepidus, Since Pompey’s feast, as Menas says, is troubled With the greensickness.	Caesar is in a sober mood.
A very fine one.	He’s a stylish man.
Oh, how he loves Caesar!	And how he loves Caesar!
Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!	Yes, but how he adores Mark Antony!
Caesar?	Caesar?
What’s Antony?	Then what’s Antony?
The god of Jupiter.	A god of a god?
Spake you of Caesar?	Are you talking about Caesar?
How, the nonpareil!	He’s without equal!
O Antony, O thou Arabian bird!	Oh, Antony!
Would you praise Caesar, say “Caesar.” Go no further.	Oh, you  If you want to praise Caesar, just say his name—that’s all the praise that’s necessary.
Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.	He certainly flattered them both with extravagant compliments.
But he loves Caesar best; yet he loves Antony.	He loves Caesar best, but he also loves Antony.
Hoo!	Oh!
Hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards, poets, cannot Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number—hoo!— His love to Antony.	Hearts cannot think it, tongues cannot speak it, meas-urements cannot calculate it, scribes cannot write it, bards cannot sing it, and poets cannot make verses about it.
Both he loves.	He loves them both.
They are his shards, and he	They are his dung, and he their beetle.
So, This is to horse.	So, there’s the signal to ride.
Adieu, noble Agrippa.	Good-bye, noble Agrippa.
Good fortune, worthy soldier, and farewell.	Good luck, worthy soldier, and good-bye.
No further, sir.	You can’t go any further with us, sir.
For better might we Have loved without this mean, if on both parts This be not cherished.	If you and I don’t value her equally, it would be better for us to work out our differences without her.
Make me not offended In your distrust.	Don’t insult me with your distrust.
I have said.	I mean what I say.
You shall not find, Though you be therein curious, the least cause For what you seem to fear.	You won’t find any cause for anxiety, even if you look for one.
So the gods keep you And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends.	So, may the gods protect you and change the hearts of the Romans so that they turn and give you their support.
We will here part.	We’ll leave you here.
Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well.	Good-bye, my dearest sister, good-bye.
The elements be kind to thee and make Thy spirits all of comfort!	I hope you have good weather to set your mind at ease.

Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear.—Prithee, tell her but a workaday fortune.	Well, if a moist palm isn’t a clear sign of promiscuity, then I can’t scratch my own ear.
Your fortunes are alike.	Your fortunes are the same.
But how, but how?	But how?
Give me particulars.	Give me details.
I have said.	I’ve said what I have to say.
Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?	Isn’t my fortune just a little better than hers?
Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than I, where would you choose it?	Well, if you could have just an inch of better fortune than me, where would you like the improvement?
Not in my husband’s nose.	Not in my husband’s nose.
Our worser thoughts heavens mend.	May heaven save us from indecent thoughts!
Alexas!	Alexas!
For, as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man loose-wived, so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded.	If it’s sad to see a handsome man with a cheating wife, it’s a tragedy to see an ugly thug with a wife who’s faithful.
Therefore, dear Isis, keep decorum, and fortune him accordingly.	Therefore, dear Isis, do the right thing and give him the fortune he deserves.
Where is the fellow?	Where is that messenger?
Half afeard to come.	He’s afraid to come in.
Go to, go to.—Come hither, sir.	Oh, come on.—Come here, sir.
Good majesty, Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you But when you are well pleased.	Gracious Queen, even Herod of Judea wouldn’t dare look at you unless you were in a good mood.

Most gracious majesty!	Most formidable Queen!
Didst thou behold Octavia?	Did you see Octavia?
Ay, dread Queen.	Yes, revered Queen.
Where?	Where?
Madam, in Rome.	In Rome, Madam.
I looked her in the face, and saw her led Between her brother and Mark Antony.	I saw her face as she walked with her brother and Mark Antony.
Is she as tall as me?	Is she as tall as I am?

Nay, the dust Should have ascended to the roof of heaven, Raised by your populous troops.	The dust from your attending troops should have risen to heaven.
We should have met you By sea and land, supplying every stage With an augmented greeting.	I would have met you by sea and again by land.

Isn’t it strange, Canidius, that he could cross the Ionian Sea so quickly from Tarentum and Brundusium and take Toryne?—Have you heard about this, sweet?
Celerity is never more admired Than by the negligent.	No one admires speed more than the lazy.
By sea, what else?	What else?
Why will My lord do so?	Why do you want to do that, my lord?
For that he dares us to ’t.	Because he’s daring us to do it.
So hath my lord dared him to single fight.	So you’ve dared him to single combat.
Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia, Where Caesar fought with Pompey.	Yes, and you dared Caesar to fight the battle at Pharsalia, where he fought against Pompey.
But these offers, Which serve not for his vantage, he shakes off, And so should you.	But Caesar ignores offers that don’t give him an advantage, and so should you.
In Caesar’s fleet Are those that often have ’gainst Pompey fought.	His ships are maneuverable.
Their ships are yare, yours, heavy.	Yours are slow and awkward.

Trust not to rotten planks.	Don’t trust rotten planks.
Do you misdoubt This sword and these my wounds?	Don’t you trust my sword and these wounds?
Let th’ Egyptians And the Phoenicians go a-ducking.	Let the Egyptians and Phoenicians go swimming.
We Have used to conquer standing on the earth And fighting foot to foot.	We are used to winning by standing on the earth and fighting toe to toe.
Well, well, away.	Well, well, let’s go.
By Hercules, I think I am i’ th’ right.	By Hercules, I think I’m right.
Soldier, thou art; but his whole action grows Not in the power on ’t.	Soldier, you are.
So our leader’s led, And we are women’s men.	Our leader is being led.
You keep by land The legions and the horse whole, do you not?	On land you keep the legions and cavalry together, don’t you?
Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius, Publicola, and Caelius, are for sea; But we keep whole by land.	Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius, Publicola, and Caelius will go by sea, but we’ll keep the bulk on land.
This speed of Caesar’s Carries beyond belief.	Caesar’s speed defies belief.
While he was yet in Rome His power went out in such distractions as Beguiled all spies.	While he was still in Rome, he deployed his forces in so many different disguises that all our spies were fooled.

Taurus!	Taurus!
My lord?	My lord?
Strike not by land; keep whole.	Don’t attack by land.
Provoke not battle Till we have done at sea.	Don’t provoke them to battle until we have finished at sea.
Our fortune lies Upon this jump.	Our fate depends on this chance.
Set we our squadrons on yond side o’ th’ hill, In eye of Caesar’s battle, from which place We may the number of the ships behold And so proceed accordingly.	Assemble our squadrons on the other side of the hill, in sight of Caesar’s navy.
I can behold no longer.	I can’t watch any more.
Gods and goddesses, All the whole synod of them!	The Egyptian flagship, the  Gods and goddesses—the whole congregation of them!
What’s thy passion?	What’s wrong with you?
The greater cantle of the world is lost With very ignorance.	We have lost a major portion of the world through utter foolishness.
We have kissed away Kingdoms and provinces.	We have kissed away entire kingdoms and provinces.
How appears the fight?	How goes the battle?
Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt— Whom leprosy o’ertake!—i’ th’ midst o’ th’ fight, When vantage like a pair of twins appeared Both as the same, or rather ours the elder, The breeze upon her, like a cow in June, Hoists sails and flies.	Right in the middle of the fight, just when the battle could have gone either way—actually we had a slight advantage—that immoral Egyptian nag—May she die of leprosy!—suddenly became frightened, and turned her ships around and fled.
That I beheld.	I saw that.
Mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not Endure a further view.	The sight made me so sick I couldn’t watch any more.
Well, what worst?	Well, give me the worst news.
The nature of bad news infects the teller.	The bearer of bad news is often blamed for it.
When it concerns the fool or coward.	Only if the hearer is a fool or a coward.
On.	Go on.
Things that are past are done, with me.	As far as I’m concerned, what’s past is done.
Tis thus: Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death, I hear him as he flattered.	It’s like this: as long as a person tells me the truth, even though it means my death, I will listen as though he praised me.
O my lord!	Oh, my lord!
Speak to me home.	Speak plainly.
Name Cleopatra as she is called in Rome.	Call Cleopatra what the Romans call her.
Oh, then we bring forth weeds When our quick minds lie still, and our ills told us Is as our earing.	It’s easy to err when left to our own devices, but criticism helps us to see our faults and correct them.
Fare thee well awhile.	Good-bye for a while.
I never saw an action of such shame.	I never saw such a shameful act.
Experience, manhood, honor, ne’er before Did violate so itself.	Terrible.

Our fortune on the sea is out of breath And sinks most lamentably.	The battle on the sea is almost lost.
Had our general Been what he knew himself, it had gone well.	If our general had been his old self, we would have won.
Oh, he has given example for our flight Most grossly by his own!	Oh, with his sordid desertion, he sets the example for our own.

Begone.	Leave.
Oh, I followed that I blush to look upon!	Oh, I followed something I’m ashamed to look at now!
My very hairs do mutiny, for the white Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them For fear and doting.	Even my hair revolts.
Friends, begone.	Friends, go.
You shall Have letters from me to some friends that will Sweep your way for you.	I’ll give you letters of introduction to some friends of mine who will help you.
Pray you, look not sad, Nor make replies of loathness.	Please, don’t be sad, and don’t tell me how reluctant you are.

O my lord, my lord, Forgive my fearful sails!	Oh, my lord, my lord, forgive my panic!
I little thought You would have followed.	I didn’t think you would follow me.
Egypt, thou knew’st too well My heart was to thy rudder tied by th’ strings, And thou shouldst tow me after.	Queen, you knew very well that my heart was tied to your ship and that you would pull me along with you.
O’er my spirit Thy full supremacy thou knew’st, and that Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods Command me.	You knew that my spirit was completely under your control and that I would ignore the gods’ orders in favor of yours.
Oh, my pardon!	Oh, forgive me!
Now I must To the young man send humble treaties, dodge And palter in the shifts of lowness, who With half the bulk o’ th’ world played as I pleased, Making and marring fortunes.	Now I will have to send my humble proposal of peace to that young man.
You did know How much you were my conqueror, and that My sword, made weak by my affection, would Obey it on all cause.	You knew that my sword, weakened by my love for you, would obey that love no matter what.

Know you him?	Do you know him?
Approach and speak.	Come forward and speak.
Such as I am, I come from Antony.	Humble as I am, I represent Antony.
I was of late as petty to his ends As is the morn-dew on the myrtle leaf To his grand sea.	Until recently, I was as unimportant to his affairs as the morning dew is to the wide ocean.
Be ’t so.	So be it.
Declare thine office.	Say what you’re here for.
Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and Requires to live in Egypt; which not granted, He lessens his requests, and to thee sues To let him breathe between the heavens and earth A private man in Athens.	If that is not granted, he reduces his requests and asks only that he be allowed to live as a private man in Athens.
This for him.	That’s all he asks for himself.
Next, Cleopatra does confess thy greatness, Submits her to thy might, and of thee craves The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs, Now hazarded to thy grace.	Cleopatra recognizes your greatness and accepts your authority.
For Antony, I have no ears to his request.	As for Antony, I’m not interested in his requests.
The Queen Of audience nor desire shall fail, so she From Egypt drive her all-disgracèd friend Or take his life there.	I’ll give the Queen a hearing and grant her requests if she either throws her dishonored friend out of Egypt or kills him.
This if she perform, She shall not sue unheard.	Then I’ll listen to her.
So to them both.	Give my answer to them both.

Is Antony or we in fault for this?	Who is to blame for this: Antony or I?
Antony only, that would make his will Lord of his reason.	Only Antony was at fault.
Why should he follow?	Why should he have followed you?
The itch of his affection should not then Have nicked his captainship at such a point When half to half the world opposed, he being The merèd question.	With half the world opposing the other half, it wasn’t the time for Antony, the pivotal player, to let love distract him.
Twas a shame no less Than was his loss, to course your flying flags And leave his navy gazing.	To race after your departing ships, leaving his navy to watch, was a shame as great as the resulting loss.

Her length of sickness, with what else more serious Importeth thee to know, this bears.	In this letter you’ll find details of her illness and other, more serious matters that concern you.
Forbear me.	Leave me.
Caesar’s will?	What does Caesar want?
Hear it apart.	It is for your ears only.
None but friends.	There are only friends here.
Say boldly.	Speak confidently.
So haply are they friends to Antony.	So they are possibly Antony’s friends.
He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has, Or needs not us.	Sir, he should have as many as Caesar has.
If Caesar please, our master Will leap to be his friend.	If Caesar chose, Antony would jump at the chance to be his friend.
For us, you know Whose he is we are, and that is Caesar’s.	As for us, you know we are Antony’s, and he is Caesar’s.
So.— Thus then, thou most renowned: Caesar entreats Not to consider in what case thou stand’st, Further than he is Caesar.	Just remember that he is Caesar.

He is a god and knows What is most right.	He is like a god and knows the truth.
Mine honor was not yielded, But conquered merely.	My honor wasn’t given; it was only dominated.
Shall I say to Caesar What you require of him?	Shall I tell Caesar what you request from him?
For he partly begs To be desired to give.	He almost begs for the opportunity to help you.
It much would please him That of his fortunes you should make a staff To lean upon.	It would please him very much if you would rely on his wealth and success to support you.
But it would warm his spirits To hear from me you had left Antony And put yourself under his shroud, The universal landlord.	But he would feel even better if I could tell him that you had left Antony and put yourself under his protection.
What’s your name?	What’s your name?
My name is Thidias.	My name is Thidias.
Most kind messenger, Say to great Caesar this in deputation: I kiss his conqu’ring hand.	Most kind messenger, tell great Caesar that through his deputy I kiss his conquering hand.

Moon and stars!	By the moon and stars!
Whip him.	Whip him!
Were ’t twenty of the greatest tributaries That do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them So saucy with the hand of she here—what’s her name Since she was Cleopatra?	If I saw twenty of the greatest powers that pay tribute to Caesar taking such liberties with her hand—what’s her name now?
Whip him, fellows, Till like a boy, you see him cringe his face And whine aloud for mercy.	Whip him, fellows, until he screws up his face like a baby and cries aloud for mercy!
Take him hence.	Take him away.
This jack of Caesar’s shall Bear us an errand to him.	Caesar’s knave will bring him a message for us.
Good my lord— You have been a boggler ever.	My good lord— You’ve always been a liar.
But when we in our viciousness grow hard— Oh, misery on ’t!—the wise gods seel our eyes, In our own filth drop our clear judgments, make us Adore our errors, laugh at ’s while we strut To our confusion.	But when our vices become habits—Oh, the sadness of it!—the wise gods blind us, shade our better judgment, make us love our mistakes, and laugh as we strut to our ruin.
Oh, is ’t come to this?	Oh, has it come to this?
I found you as a morsel cold upon Dead Caesar’s trencher.	You were a cold crumb on dead Julius Caesar’s plate when I met you.
Nay, you were a fragment Of Gneius Pompey’s, besides what hotter hours, Unregistered in vulgar fame, you have Luxuriously picked out.	No, you were one of Gneius Pompey’s leftovers—not to mention your other, more depraved affairs, which have somehow managed to avoid becoming the subject of vulgar gossip.
For I am sure, Though you can guess what temperance should be, You know not what it is.	For I’m sure that although you may know what temperance is, you’ve never experienced it firsthand.
Wherefore is this?	Why are you doing this?
Soundly, my lord.	Soundly, my lord.
Cried he?	Did he cry?
And begged he pardon?	Did he beg my pardon?
He did ask favor.	He did ask for mercy.
Have you done yet?	Are you done yet?
Alack, our terrene moon is now eclipsed, And it portends alone the fall of Antony.	You, my earthly moon, are now eclipsed, and that alone foretells my ruin.
To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes With one that ties his points?	In order to flatter Caesar, would you flirt with the servant who laces up his pants?
Not know me yet?	Don’t you know me still?
Coldhearted toward me?	Has your heart cooled toward me?
Ah, dear, if I be so, From my cold heart let heaven engender hail, And poison it in the source, and the first stone Drop in my neck.	Ah, dear, if that is true, let heaven make poisonous hail grow from my heart, and let the first hailstone drop down my throat.
As it determines, so Dissolve my life!	As it dissolves, so shall my life.
The next Caesarion smite, Till by degrees the memory of my womb, Together with my brave Egyptians all, By the discandying of this pelleted storm Lie graveless till the flies and gnats of Nile Have buried them for prey!	The next hailstone should hit Caesarion, until one by one all my children, and every one of my brave Egyptians, are killed by the dissolving of this pellet storm and lie unburied, covered by gnats and flies.

Our force by land Hath nobly held.	Our land forces have bravely stood firm.
Our severed navy too Have knit again, and fleet, threat’ning most sealike.	Our tattered navy has reassembled and set sail, as formidable as the sea itself.

I and my sword will earn our chronicle.	My sword and I will earn our place in history.
There’s hope in ’t yet.	We still have hope.
That’s my brave lord!	That’s my brave lord!
I will be treble-sinewed, -hearted, -breathed, And fight maliciously.	I’ll fight brutally.
For when mine hours Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives Of me for jests; but now I’ll set my teeth And send to darkness all that stop me.	But now I’ll grit my teeth and kill anyone who tries to stop me.
Come, Let’s have one other gaudy night.	Come, let’s have one more extravagant night.
Call to me All my sad captains.	Invite all my sad captains.
Let’s mock the midnight bell.	Let’s drink through midnight.
It is my birthday.	It’s my birthday.
I had thought t’ have held it poor; but since my lord Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.	I had planned to celebrate it quietly, but since my lord is once more himself, I will be Cleopatra again.
We will yet do well.	We’ll win yet.
Do so.	Do so.
We’ll speak to them, and tonight I’ll force The wine peep through their scars.—Come on, my Queen, There’s sap in ’t yet.	I’ll speak to them, and then tonight I’ll get them all so drunk that the wine seeps out of their old war wounds.
Now he’ll outstare the lightning.	Now he’ll work himself up to a fury.
When valor preys on reason, It eats the sword it fights with.	When courage consumes reason, it destroys its only weapon.
I will seek Some way to leave him.	I’ll look for some way to leave his service.
He calls me “boy” and chides as he had power To beat me out of Egypt.	He calls me “boy” and scolds me as if he had the power to whip me out of Egypt.
Let the old ruffian know I have many other ways to die, meantime Laugh at his challenge.	Let the old ruffian discover that I have many other ways to die, and in the meantime, we’ll laugh at his challenge.
Give him no breath, but now Make boot of his distraction.	Don’t give him time to catch his breath.
Never anger Made good guard for itself.	Anger does not protect the angry well.
Let our best heads Know that tomorrow the last of many battles We mean to fight.	Tell our top commanders that I want tomorrow’s battle to be the last we fight.
Within our files there are, Of those that served Mark Antony but late, Enough to fetch him in.	Our army has recently acquired many of Mark Antony’s former soldiers—enough to capture him.
See it done And feast the army.	See that it is done, and prepare a feast for the soldiers.
We have store to do ’t, And they have earned the waste.	We have enough supplies for it, and they’ve earned it.
Poor Antony!	Poor Antony!
What’s your pleasure, sir?	What would you like, sir?
I must with haste from hence.	I have to leave right away.
Why, then, we kill all our women.	That will kill our lovers.
We see how mortal an unkindness is to them.	We know how much they suffer if we are unkind to them.
If they suffer our departure, death’s the word.	If we leave, it will feel like nothing less than death to them.
I must be gone.	I must be gone.
Under a compelling occasion, let women die.	If it’s that important, then let the women die.
It were pity to cast them away for nothing, though between them and a great cause they should be esteemed nothing.	It would be a pity to throw them away for nothing, but if it’s a matter of choosing between them and a great cause, then they’re worthless.
Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of this, dies instantly.	If Cleopatra hears even a breath of this, she’ll die immediately.
I have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment.	I’ve seen her claim to be dying twenty times before, and for far less reason.
I do think there is mettle in death, which commits some loving act upon her, she hath such a celerity in dying.	I think there must be something invigorating about death, since she dies with such enthusiasm.
She is cunning past man’s thought.	She’s more cunning than anyone can imagine.
We cannot call her winds and waters sighs and tears.	Her sighs and tears are like great winds and floods.
He will not fight with me, Domitius?	He won’t fight with me, Domitius?
No.	No.
Why should he not?	Why won’t he?
He thinks, being twenty times of better fortune, He is twenty men to one.	He thinks that since his fortune is twenty times better than yours, it would be like pitting twenty men against one.
Tomorrow, soldier, By sea and land I’ll fight.	Tomorrow, soldier, I’ll fight by sea and land.
Or I will live Or bathe my dying honor in the blood Shall make it live again.	By the end I will either live, or else I’ll restore my honor by shedding my blood.
Woo’t thou fight well?	Will you fight well?
I’ll strike and cry, “Take all.”                                                           Well said.	When I strike, I’ll cry, “All or nothing!” Well put.
Come on!	Come on.
Call forth my household servants.	Call out my household servants.
Let’s tonight Be bounteous at our meal.	Tonight let’s have plenty to eat.
You have served me well, And kings have been your fellows.	You have all served me well, and kings are your peers.
The gods forbid!	The gods forbid!
Well, my good fellows, wait on me tonight.	Well, my good fellows, wait on me tonight.
Scant not my cups, and make as much of me As when mine empire was your fellow too, And suffered my command.	Keep my cups full and treat me as you did when my empire was one of your fellow servants, obeying my commands.
Look, they weep, And I, an ass, am onion-eyed.	Look—they’re crying.
Ho, ho, ho!	Ha, ha, ha!
Now the witch take me if I meant it thus!	May the evil one take me if I meant it like that!
Grace grow where those drops fall!	Those tears will bring blessings to you.
My hearty friends, You take me in too dolorous a sense, For I spake to you for your comfort, did desire you To burn this night with torches.	You interpret my words in a melancholy sense, my hearty friends.
Know, my hearts, I hope well of tomorrow, and will lead you Where rather I’ll expect victorious life Than death and honor.	You should know, my friends, that I have good hopes for tomorrow, and that I will lead you as if I expect victory rather than an honorable death.

Peace, I say!	Quiet, I say.
What should this mean?	What does this mean?
How now, masters?	Hello there, good sirs.

Is ’t not strange?	Isn’t it strange?
Do you hear, masters?	Do you hear that, men?
Do you hear?	Do you?

Come.	Come on.
Nay, I’ll help too.	No, I’ll help too.
What’s this for?	What’s this part for?
Ah, let be, let be!	Ah, leave it alone.
Thou art The armorer of my heart.	You armor my heart.
False, false.	No!
This, this.	No!
Sooth, la, I’ll help.	Really, I’ll help.
Thus it must be.	It must go like this.
Well, well, We shall thrive now.—Seest thou, my good fellow?	We’ve got it now.—Do you see this, my good fellow?
Go put on thy defenses.	Go and put on your own armor.
Briefly, sir.	In a minute, sir.
Is not this buckled well?	Didn’t I buckle this well?
Rarely, rarely.	Excellently, excellently.
Dispatch.—O love, That thou couldst see my wars today, and knew’st The royal occupation!	Hurry.—Oh, love, if you could only watch the battle today and see how expert I am at my craft.
Good morrow to thee.	Good morning to you.
Welcome.	Welcome.
Thou look’st like him that knows a warlike charge.	You look like a person who knows the business of war.
To business that we love we rise betimes And go to ’t with delight.	When we love our job we get up early and go to it joyfully.
A thousand, sir, Early though ’t be, have on their riveted trim And at the port expect you.	Even though it’s early, there are already a thousand armored soldiers waiting for you at the harbor.
The morn is fair.	The weather is fair.

Tis well blown, lads.	That was a fine fanfare, boys.
This morning, like the spirit of a youth That means to be of note, begins betimes.	Like a young man who wants to amount to something, this morning begins early.
Fare thee well, dame.	Farewell, lady.
Whate’er becomes of me, This is a soldier’s kiss.	Whatever happens to me, this is a soldier’s kiss.
I’ll leave thee Now like a man of steel.	I’ll leave you without revealing any emotion, like a man of steel.

The gods make this a happy day to Antony!	May the gods bless Antony today!
Would thou and those thy scars had once prevailed To make me fight at land!	I wish you and your scarred self had convinced me to wage our last battle on land.
Hadst thou done so, The kings that have revolted, and the soldier That has this morning left thee, would have still Followed thy heels.	If you had, the kings that have revolted and the soldier that deserted this morning would still be behind you.
Who’s gone this morning?	Who deserted this morning?
Who?	You don’t know?
One ever near thee.	Someone who was always near you.
Sir, He is with Caesar.	Sir, he’s with Caesar.
Sir, his chests and treasure He has not with him.	Sir, he left his belongings and treasure.
Is he gone?	He’s gone?
Most certain.	It’s certain.
Go, Eros, send his treasure after.	Eros, send his treasure to him.
Do it.	Do it now.

Write to him— I will subscribe—gentle adieus and greetings.	Write to him from me—I’ll sign it—sending greetings and gentle good-byes.
Say that I wish he never find more cause To change a master.	Say that I hope he never has cause to look for a new master.

Dispatch.—Enobarbus!	Hurry.
Fulvia is dead.	Fulvia is dead.
Sir?	Pardon me?
Fulvia is dead.	Fulvia is dead.
Fulvia?	Fulvia?
Dead.	Dead.
Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice.	Then you should offer the gods a sacrifice to show your thanks.
If there were no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut, and the case to be lamented.	If Fulvia were the last woman on earth, there would be a reason to grieve.
This grief is crowned with consolation.	But in this way, grief and comfort appear together.
Your old smock brings forth a new petticoat, and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow.	The only kind of tears you should shed in this case are the kind you might get from holding an onion to your nose.
The business she hath broached in the state Cannot endure my absence.	I must go and continue the business Fulvia started.
And the business you have broached here cannot be without you, especially that of Cleopatra’s, which wholly depends on your abode.	The business you began here needs you as well—especially the business with Cleopatra, which only you can attend to.
No more light answers.	Enough of this frivolous talk.
Let our officers Have notice what we purpose.	Give our officers notice of our intentions.
I shall break The cause of our expedience to the Queen And get her leave to part.	I’ll tell the Queen the reason for our quick departure and get her permission to leave.
For not alone The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches, Do strongly speak to us, but the letters too Of many our contriving friends in Rome Petition us at home.	Fulvia’s death and the pressing concerns related to it are not the only reasons I am eager to go; friends in Rome have also sent many letters advising my return.
Much is breeding  Which, like the courser’s hair, hath yet but life, And not a serpent’s poison.	The empire may be in danger if he’s not restrained before he reaches his full potential.
Say our pleasure, To such whose place is under us, requires Our quick remove from hence.	There are many troubles brewing now that have yet to become full-fledged threats.
Go forth, Agrippa, and begin the fight.	Agrippa, go start the battle.
Our will is Antony be took alive.	We want Antony taken alive.
Make it so known.	Make sure everyone knows that.
Caesar, I shall.	I will, Caesar.
The time of universal peace is near.	An era of universal peace is about to start.
Go charge Agrippa Plant those that have revolted in the vant, That Antony may seem to spend his fury Upon himself.	That way Antony will feel like he’s fighting his own men.
For this pains Caesar hath hanged him.	Caesar hanged him for this service.
Canidius and the rest That fell away have entertainment but No honorable trust.	Canidius and the others that left Antony are given hospitality here but no positions of trust.
I have done ill, Of which I do accuse myself so sorely That I will joy no more.	I’ve done a bad thing, for which I will blame myself so much that I’ll never be happy again.
Enobarbus, Antony Hath after thee sent all thy treasure, with His bounty overplus.	Enobarbus, Antony has sent you all your treasure, with generous gifts besides.
The messenger Came on my guard, and at thy tent is now Unloading of his mules.	The messenger arrived on my watch and is unloading his mules at your tent.
I give it you.	It’s yours.
Mock not, Enobarbus.	Don’t joke about this, Enobarbus.
I tell you true.	I’m telling you the truth.
Best you safed the bringer Out of the host.	You’d better bring the messenger safely through the lines so he can return.
I must attend mine office, Or would have done ’t myself.	I’d do it myself, but I can’t leave my post.
Your Emperor Continues still a Jove.	Your Emperor is still a king among gods.
I am alone the villain of the earth, And feel I am so most.	I am the worst person alive, and I know it the best.
O Antony, Thou mine of bounty, how wouldst thou have paid My better service, when my turpitude Thou dost so crown with gold!	Oh, Antony, you extravagantly generous man, how would you have rewarded me for serving you faithfully when you reward my badness with all of this gold!
This blows my heart.	My heart feels like it’s about to explode.
If swift thought break it not, a swifter mean Shall outstrike thought, but thought will do ’t, I feel.	If grief doesn’t kill me, I’ll find a quicker way to kill myself—even though I think grief will do the job just as well.
I fight against thee?	I, fight against you, Antony?
No, I will go seek Some ditch wherein to die.	No, I’ll go find some ditch to die in.
The foul’st best fits My latter part of life.	The foulest fate would be most appropriate for me now in this latest phase of my life.
Retire!	Retreat!
We have engaged ourselves too far.	We’ve advanced too far.
Caesar himself has work, and our oppression Exceeds what we expected.	Caesar himself is in trouble and there are more adversaries than we expected.
O my brave Emperor, this is fought indeed!	Oh, my brave Emperor, this is what I call a fight!
Had we done so at first, we had droven them home With clouts about their heads.	If we’d fought like this before, we’d have driven them home with bandaged heads.
Thou bleed’st apace.	You’re bleeding a lot.
I had a wound here that was like a “T,” But now ’tis made an “H.”                                                        They do retire.	I had a scar here that looked like a “T”; now it’s an “H.” They’re retreating.
We’ll beat ’em into bench-holes.	We’ll chase ’em into their latrines.
I have yet Room for six scotches more.	I still have room for six more wounds.
They are beaten, sir, and our advantage serves For a fair victory.	They’re retreating, sir, and our superiority indicates a clear victory.
Let us score their backs And snatch ’em up, as we take hares, behind!	Let’s slash their backs and grab ’em like we do rabbits, from behind.
Tis sport to maul a runner.	It’s fair game to mark a coward.
I will reward thee Once for thy sprightly comfort and tenfold For thy good valor.	I’ll reward you once for your cheerfulness and ten times for your courage.
Come thee on.	Come on.
I’ll halt after.	I’ll limp after you.
We have beat him to his camp.	We’ve driven him all the way back to his camp.
Run one before And let the Queen know of our gests.	One of you run to the Queen with the news.
Tomorrow, Before the sun shall see ’s, we’ll spill the blood That has today escaped.	Before sunrise tomorrow, we’ll kill anyone who escaped today.
Lord of lords!	You are all    Lord of lords!
O infinite virtue, com’st thou smiling from The world’s great snare uncaught?	Have you returned smiling from the great battle for the world?
Mine nightingale, We have beat them to their beds.	My songbird, we have beaten them to their beds.
What, girl, though gray Do something mingle with our younger brown, yet ha’ we A brain that nourishes our nerves and can Get goal for goal of youth.	What do you think, girl!
Behold this man.	Look at this man.
He hath fought today As if a god, in hate of mankind, had Destroyed in such a shape.	Today he fought as though he were a god who hated mankind.
He has deserved it, were it carbuncled Like holy Phoebus’ car.	He deserves it, even if it were covered with jewels like holy
If we be not relieved within this hour, We must return to th’ court of guard.	If we aren’t relieved in an hour, we have to return to our barracks.
O bear me witness, night— What man is this?	Oh, listen to me, night— Who is this?
Stand close and list him.	Stay hidden and listen.
Be witness to me, O thou blessèd moon, When men revolted shall upon record Bear hateful memory, poor Enobarbus did Before thy face repent.	Be my witness, oh you blessed moon.
Enobarbus?	That’s Enobarbus?
Peace!	Quiet!
Hark further.	Keep listening.
Throw my heart Against the flint and hardness of my fault, Which, being dried with grief, will break to powder And finish all foul thoughts.	My heart, which dried out with grief, will surely break apart into a powder, and that will be the end of my disgusting mind.
O Antony!	Oh, Antony!
Let’s speak to him.	Let’s speak to him.
Let’s hear him, for the things he speaks may concern Caesar.	Let’s listen to him.
Let’s do so.	Good idea.
But he sleeps.	But he’s sleeping.
Swoons rather, for so bad a prayer as his Was never yet for sleep.	No one ever gave a prayer like that before going to sleep.
Go we to him.	Let’s go to him.
Awake, sir, awake.	Wake up, sir, wake up.
Speak to us.	Speak to us.
Hear you, sir?	Do you hear us, sir?
The hand of death hath raught him.	The hand of death has taken him.
Let us bear him  To th’ court of guard.	Let’s carry him to the barracks.

Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving, And blemish Caesar’s triumph.	Get out of my sight, or I’ll give you what you deserve and spoil Caesar’s victory.
Let him take thee And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians!	Let him hoist you up in front of the shouting crowds!
Follow his chariot, like the greatest spot Of all thy sex.	Follow his chariot, like the greatest disgrace to your whole gender.

Where souls do couch on flowers, we’ll hand in hand, And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze.	In the place where souls recline on beds of flowers we’ll walk hand in hand and amaze the other ghosts with our spirited demeanor.

Put color in thy cheek.	Call up your courage.
The gods withhold me!	The gods forbid!
Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts, Though enemy, lost aim and could not?	Can I do what all the Parthian arrows, though shot by enemies, could not?
Eros, Wouldst thou be windowed in great Rome and see Thy master thus with pleached arms, bending down His corrigible neck, his face subdued To penetrative shame, whilst the wheeled seat Of fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded His baseness that ensued?	Eros, would you like to look through a window in Rome and watch your master marching in Caesar’s victory parade, his arms crossed and tied, his head bowed in submission, his face red from shame, while the chariot of triumphant Caesar precedes him, putting the final stamp to his humiliation?
I would not see ’t.	I would not.
Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn Most useful for thy country.	Draw your trustworthy sword, which you have used in such service to your country.
O sir, pardon me!	Oh, sir, pardon me!
When I did make thee free, swor’st thou not then To do this when I bade thee?	When I freed you from slavery, didn’t you swear to do this when I asked you?
Do it at once, Or thy precedent services are all But accidents unpurposed.	Do it immediately, or all your previous services to me were accidental, without purpose.
Draw and come.	Take out your sword and come on.
Turn from me then that noble countenance Wherein the worship of the whole world lies.	Then turn your noble face away from me, that face that the whole world adores.
Lo thee!	Look!
Where is he?	Where is he?
I did not see him since.	I haven’t seen him recently.
What should I do I do not?	What should I do that I’m not doing?
In each thing give him way.	Always give him his way.
Cross him in nothing.	Never contradict him.
Tempt him not so too far.	Don’t push him too far.
I wish, forbear.	I wish you’d be patient.
In time we hate that which we often fear.	We come to hate that which controls us.
But here comes Antony.	But here comes Antony.
I am sick and sullen.	I am sick and sullen.
I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose— Help me away, dear Charmian!	I’m sorry to have to say this— Help me away from here, dear Charmian!
I shall fall.	I shall faint.
My sword is drawn.	I have drawn my sword.
My dear master, My captain, and my emperor, let me say, Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell.	My dear master, my captain, my sovereign, let me say before I strike this fatal blow: farewell.
Tis said, man, and farewell.	You’ve said it, friend, and farewell to you.
Farewell, great chief.	Good-bye, great commander.
Shall I strike now?	Should I do it now?
Now, Eros.	Now, Eros.
Why, there then!	Well, then, there!
Thus I do escape the sorrow Of Antony’s death.	With this I avoid the grief of Antony’s death.
My Queen and Eros Have by their brave instruction got upon me A nobleness in record.	My Queen and Eros have by their brave examples beaten me to the history books.
To do thus I learned of thee.	I learned to do this from you.
How!	What!
Not dead?	I’m not dead?
Oh, dispatch me!	Oh, kill me!
What’s the noise?	What’s the trouble?
I have done my work ill, friends.	I’ve botched the job, friends.
Oh, make an end Of what I have begun!	Oh, finish what I’ve begun.
The star is fall’n.	Our guiding light is out.
And time is at his period.	And time itself is ended.
Alas, and woe!	Sadness and despair!
Let him that loves me strike me dead.	Whoever’s a real friend should strike me dead.
Not I.	Not me.
Nor I.	Me neither.
Nor anyone.	None of us.
Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly.	Your death and destiny advise your followers to escape.
This sword but shown to Caesar, with this tidings, Shall enter me with him.	I only need to show your sword to Caesar and tell him about your death to get into his good favor.
Where’s Antony?	Where’s Antony?
There, Diomed, there.	There, Diomedes, there.
Lives he?	Is he still alive?
Wilt thou not answer, man?	Why don’t you answer me, man?
Art thou there, Diomed?	Is that you, Diomedes?
Draw thy sword and give me Sufficing strokes for death.	Draw your sword and give me enough blows to kill me.
Most absolute lord, My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee.	Most powerful lord, my mistress Cleopatra sent me to you.
When did she send thee?	When did she send you?
Now, my lord.	Just now, my lord.
Where is she?	Where is she?
Locked in her monument.	Locked in her tomb.
She had a prophesying fear Of what hath come to pass.	She had a premonition of what has actually happened.
For when she saw— Which never shall be found—you did suspect She had disposed with Caesar, and that your rage Would not be purged, she sent you word she was dead.	Afraid that your anger would not subside, she sent you word she was dead.
Too late, good Diomed.	Too late, good Diomedes.
Call my guard, I prithee.	Call my guard, please.
What ho, the Emperor’s guard!	Hey out there!
Bear me, good friends, where Cleopatra bides.	Carry me, good friends, to where Cleopatra is.
Tis the last service that I shall command you.	It’s the last command I shall ever give you.
Woe, woe are we, sir, you may not live to wear All your true followers out.	We’re very sorry, sir, that you may not live to wear us out with your commands.
Most heavy day!	It’s a very sad day.
Nay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fate To grace it with your sorrows.	No, my friends, don’t please fate by giving it your sorrow as well.
Bid that welcome Which comes to punish us, and we punish it, Seeming to bear it lightly.	If we welcome our punishment, we punish it right back by seeming to take it lightly.
Take me up.	Pick me up.
I have led you oft; carry me now, good friends, And have my thanks for all.	I have often led you, now you must carry me, my good friends—and take my thanks for everything.
O Charmian, I will never go from hence.	Oh, Charmian, I will never leave this tomb!
Be comforted, dear madam.	Be calm, dear lady.
No, I will not.	No, I won’t.
All strange and terrible events are welcome, But comforts we despise.	Strange and terrible events are all welcome, but I despise comforts.
Our size of sorrow, Proportioned to our cause, must be as great As that which makes it.	The size of my sorrow must be as great as its source.
How now?	What’s the news!
Is he dead?	Is he dead?
His death’s upon him, but not dead.	He is close to death, but not dead yet.
O Antony, Antony, Antony!	Oh, Antony, Antony, Antony!
Help, Charmian, help, Iras, help!	Help, Charmian, help, Iras, help!
Peace!	Be calm!
Not Caesar’s valor hath o’erthrown Antony, But Antony’s hath triumphed on itself.	It was not Caesar’s bravery that conquered Antony but Antony’s that has triumphed over himself.
So it should be, that none but Antony Should conquer Antony, but woe ’tis so!	That’s the way it should be—only Antony should conquer Antony.
Nay, but this dotage of our general’s O’erflows the measure.	No, our general’s infatuation is out of control.
Those his goodly eyes, That o’er the files and musters of the war Have glowed like plated Mars, now bend, now turn The office and devotion of their view Upon a tawny front.	His eyes used to glow with pride when he reviewed his troops.
His captain’s heart, Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper And is become the bellows and the fan To cool a gypsy’s lust.	His heart used to burst the buckles on his breastplate in great fights, but now he’s lost all temperance and dedicates his heart to satisfying the lust of an Egyptian whore.
Look where they come.	Look at them.
Take but good note, and you shall see in him The triple pillar of the world transformed Into a strumpet’s fool.	Take a good look, and you’ll see that one of the three men who rule the world has turned into a whore’s jester.
Behold and see.	Look and see.
If it be love indeed, tell me how much.	If what you feel is really love, tell me how much.
There’s beggary in the love that can be reckoned.	It would be a pretty stingy love if it could be counted and calculated.
I’ll set a bourn how far to be beloved.	I want to measure the extent of your love, to see how far it stretches.
Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.	Then you would have to go beyond heaven, beyond earth.
News, my good lord, from Rome.	I have news from Rome, my good lord.
I am dying, Egypt, dying.	I am dying, Cleopatra, dying.
Only I here importune death awhile, until Of many thousand kisses the poor last I lay upon thy lips.	I just beg death to wait awhile, until I place the last of our many thousands of kisses on your lips.
I dare not, dear, Dear my lord, pardon, I dare not, Lest I be taken.	I don’t dare come down—forgive me, my lord—I don’t dare, for fear of capture.
Not th’ imperious show Of the full-fortuned Caesar ever shall Be brooched with me.	I will never be exhibited as lucky Caesar’s prize.
If knife, drugs, serpents, have Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe.	If knives, poison, or snakes have edge, effect, or venom, I am safe from that fate.
Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyes And still conclusion, shall acquire no honor Demuring upon me.	Your wife Octavia, with her self-effacing eyes and self-righteous assumptions, won’t get any praise from patronizing me.
Assist, good friends.	Help us, good friends.
Oh, quick, or I am gone.	Oh, quick, before I’m gone.
Here’s sport indeed!	Such exercise!
How heavy weighs my lord!	My lord is so heavy!
Had I great Juno’s power, The strong-winged Mercury should fetch thee up And set thee by Jove’s side.	If I had the goddess Juno’s power, I would make the strong-winged messenger, Mercury, pick you up and seat you beside Jove.
And welcome, welcome!	And welcome, welcome!
Die when thou hast lived.	Die where you have lived, in my arms.
Had my lips that power, Thus would I wear them out.	If my lips had the power to give life, I would wear them out like this.
A heavy sight!	What a sad sight!
I am dying, Egypt, dying.	I am dying, Cleopatra, dying.
Give me some wine and let me speak a little.	Give me some wine and let me say a few words.
My resolution and my hands I’ll trust, None about Caesar.	I’ll trust my determination and my hands, but none of Caesar’s men.
Now my spirit is going.	Now I feel my soul leaving.
I can no more.	I can’t speak any more.
Noblest of men, woo’t die?	Most noble man, will you die?
Hast thou no care of me?	Don’t you care about me?
Shall I abide In this dull world, which in thy absence is No better than a sty?	Shall I stay in this dreary world, which is no better than a pigsty without you?
My lord!	My lord!
Oh, withered is the garland of the war.	Oh, the glory of war has faded.
The soldier’s pole is fall’n!	The flags have fallen.
Young boys and girls Are level now with men.	Young boys and girls are equal to men.
The odds is gone, And there is nothing left remarkable Beneath the visiting moon.	There is nothing distinctive, nothing remarkable left in the world.
She’s dead too, our sovereign.	Our Queen is dead too.
Lady!	Lady!
Madam!	Madam!
O madam, madam, madam!	Oh, madam, madam, madam!
Royal Egypt, Empress!	Royal Egypt, Empress!
Peace, peace, Iras.	Quiet, quiet, Iras.
No more but e’en a woman, and commanded By such poor passion as the maid that milks And does the meanest chares.	Now I am no more than a woman, ruled by the same lowly passion as the maid who milks and does the humblest chores.
All’s but naught.	Now all is for nothing.
How do you, women?	How are you, my ladies?
What, what, good cheer!	Cheer up!
Why, how now, Charmian?	How are you, Charmian?
My noble girls!	My gallant girls!
Good sirs, take heart.	Good noble ladies, be brave.
We’ll bury him, and then, what’s brave, what’s noble, Let’s do ’t after the high Roman fashion And make death proud to take us.	We’ll bury him, and then we’ll commit acts as brave and fine as any Romans, and make death proud to take us.
Come, away.	Come on, you can go.
This case of that huge spirit now is cold.	The container of that great soul is now cold.
Ah, women, women!	Ah, ladies, ladies!
Come.	Let’s go.
We have no friend But resolution, and the briefest end.	We have no friends but determination and the quickest death.
Go to him, Dolabella, bid him yield.	Tell him to surrender.
Being so frustrate, tell him, he mocks The pauses that he makes.	His position is hopeless.
Caesar, I shall.	Right away, Caesar.
Wherefore is that?	What are you doing with a sword?
And what art thou that dar’st Appear thus to us?	Who do you think you are coming in here armed?
I am called Dercetus.	My name is Decretus.
Mark Antony I served, who best was worthy Best to be served.	I served Mark Antony, who was the commander most worthy of my services.
Whilst he stood up and spoke, He was my master, and I wore my life To spend upon his haters.	While he was alive, I lived only to serve him and oppose his enemies.
If thou pleasest not, I yield thee up my life.	If not, you can kill me.
What is ’t thou say’st?	What are you saying?
I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.	Caesar, I’m telling you that Antony is dead.
The breaking of so great a thing should make A greater crack.	When such a great man dies there should be a thunderclap.
The round world Should have shook lions into civil streets And citizens to their dens.	The fractured world, in its confusion, should send lions into the city streets and humans into the wilderness to live in lions’ dens.
The death of Antony Is not a single doom.	This isn’t the death of one man.
In the name lay A moiety of the world.	It’s the death of half the world.
Now, my dearest Queen— Pray you, stand farther from me.	Now, my dearest Queen— Please, stand farther away from me.
What’s the matter?	What’s the matter?
I know by that same eye there’s some good news.	I can see in your eyes there’s been some good news.
What, says the married woman you may go?	What, does your wife say you can come home?
Would she had never given you leave to come!	I wish she’d never let you come.
Let her not say ’tis I that keep you here.	Don’t let her say I kept you.
I have no power upon you.	I have no power over you.
Hers you are.	You belong to her.
The gods best know—                                              Oh never was there queen So mightily betrayed!	The gods know— Oh, never has a queen been so betrayed as I have been.
Yet at the first I saw the treasons planted.	I knew from the first it would be this way.
Cleopatra— Why should I think you can be mine, and true— Though you in swearing shake the thronèd gods— Who have been false to Fulvia?	Cleopatra— How could I have ever thought that you would be faithful and true, even though your vows of love shook the heavens themselves—you, who were unfaithful to Fulvia?
Riotous madness, To be entangled with those mouth-made vows Which break themselves in swearing!	It was wild insanity to believe promises made by the mouth and not the heart.
When you sued staying, Then was the time for words.	When you begged to stay, that was the time for words.
No going then!	You didn’t want to go then!
Eternity was in our lips and eyes, Bliss in our brows’ bent, none our parts so poor But was a race of heaven.	You saw eternity in my lips and eyes, and happiness in the arch of my eyebrows.
They are so still, Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world, Art turned the greatest liar.	My features are still that beautiful—or else you, the greatest soldier in the world, have become the greatest liar by overpraising them.
This is his sword.	This is his sword.
I robbed his wound of it.	I pulled it from his wound.
Behold it stained With his most noble blood.	Look—his noble blood is still on it.
Look you, sad friends, The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings To wash the eyes of kings.	Listen, sad friends, though the gods may rebuke me, this news would make kings cry.
His taints and honors Waged equal with him.	His faults were equally matched by his virtues.
A rarer spirit never Did steer humanity, but you gods will give us Some faults to make us men.	But gods, you give us faults so we’ll be human.
Caesar is touched.	Caesar is upset.
I must perforce Have shown to thee such a declining day, Or look on thine.	Either I had to ruin you, or you would have ruined me.
Hear me, good friends—	Let me tell you, friends—
But I will tell you at some meeter season.	I’ll tell you at a better time.
The business of this man looks out of him.	This man looks like his business is urgent.
We’ll hear him what he says.	Let’s hear what he has to say.
Bid her have good heart.	Tell her to put her mind at rest.
She soon shall know of us, by some of ours, How honorable and how kindly we Determine for her, for Caesar cannot live To be ungentle.	She’ll find out soon enough by one of our messengers how respectfully and kindly we plan to treat her.
So the gods preserve thee!	May the gods bless you.
Come hither, Proculeius.	Come here, Proculeius.
Go and say We purpose her no shame.	Tell her we mean her no disrespect.
Go, And with your speediest bring us what she says And how you find of her.	Go, and hurry back to bring us her reply and news of her state of mind.
Caesar, I shall.	I will, Caesar.
Gallus, go you along.	Gallus, you go with him.
Where’s Dolabella, To second Proculeius?	Where’s Dolabella?
Dolabella!	Dolabella!
Let him alone, for I remember now How he’s employed.	I remember he’s already occupied.
He shall in time be ready.	He’ll be done in time.
Go with me and see What I can show in this.	Come and see the proof.
Tis paltry to be Caesar.	It’s pathetic to be Caesar.
Not being Fortune, he’s but Fortune’s knave, A minister of her will.	He can’t be Fortune; he’s only Fortune’s errand boy.
Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt, And bids thee study on what fair demands Thou mean’st to have him grant thee.	Caesar greets the Queen of Egypt and asks that you consider what you will ask from him.
What’s thy name?	What’s your name?
My name is Proculeius.	My name is Proculeius.
Antony Did tell me of you, bade me trust you, but I do not greatly care to be deceived, That have no use for trusting.	But I don’t worry about being deceived because I don’t need to trust.
If your master Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him, That majesty, to keep decorum, must No less beg than a kingdom.	If your master wants a queen to beg from him, you should tell him that a queen will beg for no less than a kingdom.
If he please To give me conquered Egypt for my son, He gives me so much of mine own as I Will kneel to him with thanks.	If he will grant me conquered Egypt, so that I may give it to my son, I will kneel to him with thanks.
Be of good cheer.	Be content.
You’re fall’n into a princely hand.	You’re in the charge of an honorable man.
Fear nothing.	Don’t be afraid.
Let me report to him Your sweet dependency, and you shall find A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness Where he for grace is kneeled to.	If I can tell him that you have submitted to him sweetly, he’ll request your assistance in finding ways in which he can support you.
Pray you, tell him I am his fortune’s vassal, and I send him The greatness he has got.	Please tell him I have surrendered to his fortune.

This I’ll report, dear lady.	I’ll tell him all of this, dear lady.
You see how easily she may be surprised.	Be at ease.
Royal Queen!	Your majesty!
O Cleopatra!	Oh, Cleopatra!
Hold, worthy lady, hold!	Stop, brave lady, stop!
Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this Relieved but not betrayed.	We have not betrayed you.
What, of death too, That rids our dogs of languish?	What, am I being denied death, as well?
Cleopatra, Do not abuse my master’s bounty by Th’ undoing of yourself.	Don’t insult my master’s generosity by killing yourself.
Let the world see His nobleness well acted, which your death Will never let come forth.	Your death would prevent that.
Where art thou, Death?	Where are you, Death?
Come hither, come!	Come here.
Come, come and take a queen Worth many babes and beggars!	Come, and you can have a queen.
Oh, temperance, lady!	Oh, control yourself, lady!
This mortal house I’ll ruin, Do Caesar what he can.	Let Caesar do whatever he wants.
Know, sir, that I Will not wait pinioned at your master’s court, Nor once be chastised with the sober eye Of dull Octavia.	You’d better understand that I won’t wait till I’m chained up in your master’s court, and I won’t let myself be scolded even once by dull Octavia.
Shall they hoist me up And show me to the shouting varletry Of censuring Rome?	Shall I let them exhibit me to the shouting mobs of Rome?
Rather a ditch in Egypt Be gentle grave unto me.	I’d rather die in a ditch in Egypt, and make it my gentle grave.
Rather on Nilus’ mud Lay me stark naked and let the waterflies Blow me into abhorring.	I’d rather lie in the Nile mud with flies laying their eggs in me, making me disgusting.
Rather make My country’s high pyramides my gibbet And hang me up in chains!	I’d rather be hung in chains from one of our pyramids!
You do extend These thoughts of horror further than you shall Find cause in Caesar.	You’ll see that Caesar is giving you no reason to do so.
Proculeius, What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows, And he hath sent for thee.	Proculeius, Caesar has heard about what you’ve done here and has sent for you.
For the Queen, I’ll take her to my guard.	I’ll take the Queen into my custody.
So, Dolabella, It shall content me best.	So be it, Dolabella.
Be gentle to her.	Be kind to her.
Most noble Empress, you have heard of me?	Have you heard of me, most noble Empress?
I cannot tell.	I don’t remember.
You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams.	You must be the one who laughs when boys or women tell you their dreams.
Is ’t not your trick?	Isn’t that your habit?
I understand not, madam.	I don’t know what you mean, madam.
I dreamt there was an emperor Antony.	I dreamed about an emperor called Antony.
Oh, such another sleep, that I might see But such another man!	Oh, I wish I could sleep again, so I could have another dream like that!
His reared arm Crested the world.	When he raised his arm in command, the world trembled.
For his bounty, There was no winter in ’t, an autumn ’twas That grew the more by reaping.	There was no end to his generosity.
In his livery Walked crowns and crownets.	Kings and noblemen served him.
Realms and islands were As plates dropped from his pocket.	Kingdoms and provinces dropped from his pockets like loose change.
Cleopatra— Think you there was or might be such a man As this I dreamt of?	Cleopatra— Do you think there ever was, or could there ever be, a man such as the one I dreamed about?
Gentle madam, no.	No, gentle madam.
You lie up to the hearing of the gods.	The gods can hear you lying!
Nature wants stuff To vie strange forms with fancy, yet t’ imagine An Antony were nature’s piece ’gainst fancy, Condemning shadows quite.	Antony would easily outshine all imaginary beings.
Hear me, good madam.	Listen to me, madam.
Your loss is as yourself, great, and you bear it As answering to the weight.	You are a remarkable person and your loss is equally remarkable.
Would I might never O’ertake pursued success, but I do feel, By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites My very heart at root.	I hope I never achieve success if I don’t feel some of your heartbroken grief right now.
I thank you, sir.	Thank you, sir.
Know you what Caesar means to do with me?	Do you know what Caesar intends to do with me?
I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.	I’m reluctant to tell you what I wish you knew.
Arise, you shall not kneel.	You need not kneel to me.
I pray you, rise.	Please rise, Queen.
Sir, the gods Will have it thus.	The gods have ordained it to be like this, sir.
Take to you no hard thoughts.	Don’t think I blame you.
I’ll take my leave.	I’ll leave you now.
And may, through all the world!	You may do whatever you want in the world.
Tis yours, and we, Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall Hang in what place you please.	It’s yours, and you may hang us, your trophies of war, anywhere you like.
Here, my good lord.	Here, my good lord.
How now, lady?	What do you mean, lady?
I would I had thy inches.	I wish I were as big and strong as you.
Thou shouldst know There were a heart in Egypt.	Listen to me, Queen.

My more particular, And that which most with you should safe my going, Is Fulvia’s death.	But my personal motivation—and that which should move you most to sanction my departure—is that Fulvia is dead.
Can Fulvia die?	Is it possible Fulvia is dead?
She’s dead, my Queen.	She’s dead, my Queen.
You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.	You shall advise me in everything having to do with Cleopatra.
This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels I am possessed of.	This is the inventory of the money, silverware, dishes, and jewels that are still in my possession.
Tis exactly valued, Not petty things admitted.	Not even trivial things were left out.
Where’s Seleucus?	Where’s Seleucus?
Here, madam.	Here, madam.
This is my treasurer.	This is my treasurer.
Let him speak, my lord, Upon his peril, that I have reserved To myself nothing.	My lord, he will swear on his life that I haven’t kept a thing.—Tell the truth, Seleucus.
Madam, I had rather seal my lips Than to my peril speak that which is not.	Madam, I’d rather sew my lips shut than tell a lie when my life depends upon it.
What have I kept back?	What did I keep for myself?
Enough to purchase what you have made known.	Enough to buy everything you have declared.
Nay, blush not, Cleopatra.	No, don’t be ashamed, Cleopatra.
See, Caesar!	Look around you, Caesar.
Oh, behold How pomp is followed!	Oh, just see what happens after the pageantry is over!
The ingratitude of this Seleucus does Even make me wild.	Seleucus’ ingratitude makes me wild.
Thou shalt Go back, I warrant thee!	I’ll give you a good reason to cringe, I promise you.
But I’ll catch thine eyes, Though they had wings.	I’ll scratch out your eyes, even if they could fly.
Oh, rarely base!	Oh, that was unbelievably low!
Cleopatra, Not what you have reserved nor what acknowledged Put we i’ th’ roll of conquest.	Cleopatra, our conquest won’t include either the things you kept back or the ones you listed.
Still be ’t yours.	It’s all still yours.
Bestow it at your pleasure, and believe Caesar’s no merchant, to make prize with you Of things that merchants sold.	Do whatever you like with it.
Therefore be cheered.	So cheer up.

Thou an Egyptian puppet shalt be shown In Rome, as well as I.	You will be exhibited in Rome along with me, like Egyptian puppets.
Mechanic slaves With greasy aprons, rules, and hammers shall Uplift us to the view.	Crude slaves with greasy aprons, rulers, and hammers shall lift us up so everyone can see.

Nay, ’tis most certain, Iras.	No, it’s certain, Iras.
Oh, the good gods!	Insolent  Oh, the good gods!

Show me, my women, like a queen.	Women, dress me like a queen.
Go fetch My best attires.	Go get my best clothes.
Wherefore’s this noise?	What’s that noise?
Here is a rural fellow That will not be denied your Highness’ presence.	There’s a farmer here who won’t leave without seeing your Highness.
He brings you figs.	He has brought you figs.
Let him come in.	Let him come in.
What poor an instrument May do a noble deed!	What a poor instrument, that can do such a noble deed!
He brings me liberty.	He brings me freedom.
My resolution’s placed, and I have nothing Of woman in me.	There’s nothing of the weak woman left in me.
Now from head to foot I am marble-constant.	Now from head to foot I’m as firm as marble.
Now the fleeting moon No planet is of mine.	Now the inconstant moon has nothing to do with me.
This is the man.	This is the man.
Avoid, and leave him.	Leave us.
Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there, That kills and pains not?	Do you have in there the pretty snake of the Nile that kills without pain?
Truly, I have him, but I would not be the party that should desire you to touch him, for his biting is immortal.	I certainly do have him, but I wouldn’t advise you to touch him.
Those that do die of it do seldom or never recover.	People who die of it seldom or never recover.
Remember’st thou any that have died on ’t?	Do you remember anyone who died of it?
Very many, men and women too.	Many people, men and women alike.
Truly, she makes a very good report o’ th’ worm.	Indeed, she gives a very good testimony of the snake’s power.
But he that will believe all that they say shall never be saved by half that they do.	But if you believe everything they say, you won’t be saved by half of what they do.
But this is most falliable, the worm’s an odd worm.	But this is a sure thing: the snake’s an odd snake.
I wish you all joy of the worm.	I hope you are pleased with the snake.
Farewell.	Farewell.
You must think this, look you, that the worm will do his kind.	You must know that the snake will act according to his nature.
Ay, ay.	Yes, yes.
Farewell.	Farewell.
Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping of wise people, for indeed there is no goodness in the worm.	There isn’t any kindness in the snake.
Very good.	Good.
Will it eat me?	Will it eat me?
You must not think I am so simple but I know the devil himself will not eat a woman.	Don’t think I’m so dumb that I don’t know that the devil himself won’t eat a woman.
Well, get thee gone.	Well, you can go now.
Farewell.	Farewell.
Give me my robe.	Give me my robe.
Put on my crown.	Put on my crown.
I have Immortal longings in me.	I long to be immortal.

Methinks I hear Antony call.	I think I hear Antony call me.
I see him rouse himself To praise my noble act.	I see him revive himself to praise my noble act.
I hear him mock The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men To excuse their after wrath.—Husband, I come!	I hear him mock Caesar’s luck, which the gods give to men in order to balance out their subsequent wrath.
Now to that name my courage prove my title!	Now let my courage prove my title as wife.
I am fire and air, my other elements I give to baser life.—So, have you done?	So, are you done?
Come then and take the last warmth of my lips.	Come then, kiss me and take the last bit of warmth from my lips.
Farewell, kind Charmian.	Good-bye, kind Charmian.
Iras, long farewell.	Iras, I won’t see you again for a long time.
Have I the aspic in my lips?	Do I have the asp’s poison on my lips?
Dost fall?	Did you fall?
If thou and nature can so gently part, The stroke of death is as a lover’s pinch, Which hurts, and is desired.	If you can leave your body so easily, then the touch of death is like a lover’s pinch, which hurts but is desired.
Dost thou lie still?	Do you lie still?
If thus thou vanishest, thou tell’st the world It is not worth leave-taking.	If you leave like that, you tell the world that it’s not worthy of a good-bye.
Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain, that I may say The gods themselves do weep!	Clouds, dissolve into rain, so that I could say the gods themselves are weeping!
Come, thou mortal wretch, With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate Of life at once untie.	Separate me from life with your sharp teeth.
Poor venomous fool Be angry and dispatch.	Poor poisonous fool, be angry and bite.
Oh, couldst thou speak, That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass Unpolicied!	Oh, if you could speak, I might hear you call Caesar an ass who’s been outsmarted!
O eastern star!	Oh, eastern star!
Peace, peace!	Quiet, quiet!
Dost thou not see my baby at my breast, That sucks the nurse asleep?	Don’t you see my baby suckling at my breast so that its nurse will fall asleep?
As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle— O Antony!—Nay, I will take thee too.	The poison is as sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle—Oh, Antony!—No, I’ll take you too.
What should I stay— In this wild world?	Why should I stay— In this vile world?
So, fare thee well.	So, good-bye.
Now boast thee, Death, in thy possession lies A lass unparalleled.	Now, Death, you can boast that you have an incomparable girl in your possession.
Downy windows, close,	Close, soft eyes.
And golden Phoebus never be beheld Of eyes again so royal!	The sun will never be seen by such royal eyes again.
Your crown’s awry.	Your crown is crooked.
I’ll mend it and then play— Where’s the Queen?	I’ll straighten it, then play— Where’s the Queen?
Speak softly.	Speak softly.
Wake her not.	Don’t wake her.
Caesar hath sent—                                        Too slow a messenger.	Caesar has sent— Too slow a messenger.
Oh, come apace, dispatch!	Oh, come quickly!
I partly feel thee.	I almost feel you.
There’s Dolabella sent from Caesar.	There’s Dolabella, who was sent from Caesar.
Call him.	Call him.
What work is here, Charmian?	What kind of work is this, Charmian?
Is this well done?	Is this well done?
It is well done and fitting for a princess Descended of so many royal kings.	It is well done, and appropriate for a princess who has descended from so many royal kings.
Ah, soldier!	Ah, soldier!
How goes it here?	What’s going on in here?
All dead.	They’re all dead.
Caesar, thy thoughts Touch their effects in this.	Caesar, you thought this would happen.
Thyself art coming To see performed the dreaded act which thou So sought’st to hinder.	You’re coming here yourself to see the dreaded act you had tried to stop.
O most false love!	Oh, unfaithful lover!
Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill With sorrowful water?	Stop arguing and listen to my plans.
Now I see, I see, In Fulvia’s death how mine received shall be.	Whether I go ahead with them or not is completely up to you.
By the fire That quickens Nilus’ slime, I go from hence Thy soldier, servant, making peace or war As thou affects.	I swear by the sun that when I leave here, it will be as your faithful servant.
Cut my lace, Charmian, come!	Cut my corset laces, Charmian, so I can breathe.
But let it be.	Hurry!
I am quickly ill, and well, So Antony loves.	Just as Antony loves.
My precious Queen, forbear, And give true evidence to his love which stands An honorable trial.	Control yourself, my precious Queen, and concede that my love is true.
So Fulvia told me.	That’s what Fulvia told me.
I prithee, turn aside and weep for her.	I beg you, turn away and cry for her.
Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears Belong to Egypt.	Then say good-bye to me and tell me those tears were for my benefit.
O sir, you are too sure an augurer.	Oh, sir, you are too good at predicting the future.
That you did fear is done.	What you were afraid of has happened.
The manner of their deaths?	How did they die?
I do not see them bleed.	I don’t see any blood.
Who was last with them?	Who was with them last?
A simple countryman that brought her figs.	A simple country farmer who brought her figs.
This was his basket.	This was the basket.
Poisoned, then.	They were poisoned, then.
Oh, Caesar, This Charmian lived but now.	Oh, Caesar, this Charmian lived until a moment ago.
She stood and spake.	She stood and spoke.
I found her trimming up the diadem On her dead mistress.	I found her adjusting the crown on her dead mistress.
Tremblingly she stood And on the sudden dropped.	She stood trembling, then suddenly dropped dead.
Oh, noble weakness!	Oh, noble weakness!
Here on her breast There is a vent of blood, and something blown.	Here on her breast there’s a little bloody mark.
The like is on her arm.	There’s a similar mark on her arm.
This is an aspic’s trail, and these fig leaves Have slime upon them, such as th’ aspic leaves Upon the caves of Nile.	This is an asp’s trail, and these fig leaves have slime on them, just like the kind that asps deposit on the caves by the Nile.
Take up her bed And bear her women from the monument.	Pick up her bed and carry her ladies out of the tomb.
She shall be buried by her Antony.	She shall be buried next to her Antony.
No grave upon the earth shall clip in it A pair so famous.	No other grave on earth shall hold a pair this famous.
Our army shall In solemn show attend this funeral, And then to Rome.	Our army shall somberly attend this funeral and then depart for Rome.
Come, Dolabella, see High order in this great solemnity.	Come, Dolabella.
You’ll heat my blood.	You’ll make me angry.
No more.	No more of this.
You can do better yet, but this is meetly.	I know you can do better than that, but it’ll do for now.
Now, by my sword—                                              And target.	I swear by my sword— Swear by your shield, too!
I’ll leave you, lady.	I’ll leave you, lady.
Courteous lord, one word.	Polite sir, let me say one thing.
Sir, you and I must part, but that’s not it.	Sir, you and I must part company—no, that’s not it.
Tis sweating labor To bear such idleness so near the heart As Cleopatra this.	It’s difficult to have such immaturity so close to my heart, but bear with me.
But, sir, forgive me, Since my becomings kill me when they do not Eye well to you.	Even the traits that become me most kill me when you don’t approve of them.
Your honor calls you hence.	Your honor is the reason you are leaving.
Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly, And all the gods go with you!	May the gods be with you.
Upon your sword Sit laurel victory, and smooth success Be strewed before your feet.	May your sword be victorious and everything you do succeed.
Let us go.	Let’s go.
Come.	Come with me.
Our separation so abides and flies That thou, residing here, goes yet with me, And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee.	Our imminent separation so occupies our thoughts that even though you stay here, you come with me, and even though I leave here, I stay with you.
You are too indulgent.	You’re too forgiving.
Say this becomes him— As his composure must be rare indeed Whom these things cannot blemish—yet must Antony No way excuse his foils when we do bear So great weight in his lightness.	Even if we said that this behavior suits him—though only a man with a perfect character could avoid being disgraced by such antics—there’s no excuse for the extra work we’ve had to take on while he’s been off amusing himself.
If he filled His vacancy with his voluptuousness, Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones Call on him for ’t.	If he’s been spending his leisure time in lustful pursuits, then he’ll be punished with venereal diseases, and that’s his business.
Here’s more news.	Here’s more news.
Pompey is strong at sea, And it appears he is beloved of those That only have feared Caesar.	Pompey has a strong navy.
I should have known no less.	I should have known it.
It hath been taught us from the primal state That he which is was wished until he were, And the ebbed man, ne’er loved till ne’er worth love, Comes deared by being lacked.	It’s been this way ever since the first government was organized.
Caesar, I bring thee word Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates, Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound With keels of every kind.	Caesar, I have news about Menecrates and Menas, notorious pirates who prowl the sea in a variety of ships.
Many hot inroads They make in Italy—the borders maritime Lack blood to think on ’t—and flush youth revolt.	They’ve made many raids upon Italy—and the naval patrols go pale at even the thought of resisting them.
Antony, Leave thy lascivious wassails.	Antony, it’s time to stop your wild hedonism.
When thou once Wast beaten from Modena, where thou slew’st Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel Did famine follow, whom thou fought’st against, Though daintily brought up, with patience more Than savages could suffer.	And even though you were brought up as a gentleman, you patiently tolerated more hardships than savages could withstand.
Thou didst drink The stale of horses and the gilded puddle Which beasts would cough at.	You drank horses’ urine and water from scum-covered puddles that even animals would refuse.
Tis pity of him.	It’s too bad.
Let his shames quickly Drive him to Rome.	Let’s hope his sense of shame will send him back to Rome quickly.
Tis time we twain Did show ourselves i’ th’ field, and to that end Assemble we immediate council.	It’s time that we brought our armies into the field.
Pompey Thrives in our idleness.	Pompey is making the most of our absence.
Tomorrow, Caesar, I shall be furnished to inform you rightly Both what by sea and land I can be able To front this present time.	Tomorrow, Caesar, I’ll be able to tell you what land and sea forces I can raise for this war.
Till which encounter It is my business too.	I’ll be getting my own figures together in the meantime.
Farewell.	Good-bye.
Farewell, my lord.	Good-bye, my lord.
Charmian!	Charmian!
Madam?	Madam?
That I might sleep out this great gap of time My Antony is away.	So I can sleep away the time while my Antony is gone.
You think of him too much.	You think about him too much.
Oh, ’tis treason!	That’s treason!
Madam, I trust, not so.	I hope not, Madam.
What’s your highness’ pleasure?	What can I do for your highness?
Not now to hear thee sing.	I don’t want to hear you sing.
I take no pleasure In aught an eunuch has.	I’m not interested in anything a eunuch can do.
Tis well for thee That, being unseminared, thy freer thoughts May not fly forth of Egypt.	It’s a good thing for you that, being castrated, you can better concentrate on my needs.
Hast thou affections?	Do you have desires?
Yes, gracious madam.	Yes, dear madam.
Indeed?	Indeed?
Not in deed, madam, for I can do nothing But what indeed is honest to be done.	Well, not in deed, madam, since I can’t do anything unchaste.
Stands he or sits he?	Is he standing or sitting?
Or does he walk?	Or is he walking?
Or is he on his horse?	Or is he on his horse?
O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!	Oh, how fortunate that horse is to have Antony on him.
He’s speaking now, Or murmuring “Where’s my serpent of old Nile?” For so he calls me.	He’s speaking now, or perhaps he’s whispering, “Where’s my serpent of the Nile?” For that’s his pet name for me.
Now I feed myself With most delicious poison.	I’m killing myself with this provocative speculation . . .
Think on me, That am with Phoebus’ amorous pinches black And wrinkled deep in time.	Are you thinking about me?
Nay, hear them, Antony.	No, listen to it, Antony.
Perform ’t, or else we damn thee.”                                                                     How, my love?	Perhaps  What, my love?
Perchance?	Maybe?
Nay, and most like.	No, most likely.
You must not stay here longer.	You can’t stay here any longer.
Call in the messengers.	Call in the messengers and we’ll find out.
As I am Egypt’s queen, Thou blushest, Antony, and that blood of thine Is Caesar’s homager.	As surely as I am the queen of Egypt, Antony, you’re blushing, which means you’re Caesar’s servant.
The messengers!	Call the messengers!
Sovereign of Egypt, hail!	Queen of Egypt, greetings!
How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!	You are nothing like Mark Antony!
Yet, coming from him, that great med’cine hath With his tinct gilded thee.	But since you come from him, you’re saturated with his healing spirit.
How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?	How does it go with my magnificent Mark Antony?
Last thing he did, dear Queen, He kissed—the last of many doubled kisses— This orient pearl.	The last thing he did before sending me off, dear Queen, was to kiss—the last of many such kisses—this Indian pearl for you.
Mine ear must pluck it thence.	My ear must pull it out.
Good friend,” quoth he, “Say the firm Roman to great Egypt sends This treasure of an oyster, at whose foot, To mend the petty present, I will piece Her opulent throne with kingdoms.	Good friend,” he said, “say that the faithful Roman sends an oyster’s treasure to the great Queen of Egypt, and that he plans to enhance this meager gift by adding new kingdoms to her empire.
All the East, Say thou, shall call her mistress.” So he nodded, And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed, Who neighed so high that what I would have spoke Was beastly dumbed by him.	Tell her that the entire East shall call her Queen.” Then he nodded and solemnly mounted an armored warhorse, which neighed so loudly it effectively silenced anything I might have said in reply.
What was he, sad or merry?	Was he sad or happy?
Like to the time o’ th’ year between the extremes Of hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merry.	He was like that time of year halfway between the extremes of hot and cold: he was neither sad nor happy.
Note him, Note him, good Charmian, ’tis the man, but note him.	Just notice.
He was not sad, for he would shine on those That make their looks by his.	He wasn’t sad, because he knows that his disposition affects others.
He was not merry, Which seemed to tell them his remembrance lay In Egypt with his joy, but between both.	He was somewhere in the middle, between them . . .
O heavenly mingle!	Oh, heavenly mixture!
Be’st thou sad or merry, The violence of either thee becomes, So does it no man else.—Mett’st thou my posts?	Whether you are sad or merry, the intensity of either suits you like no one else . . .
Ay, madam, twenty several messengers.	Yes, madam, twenty different messengers.
Why do you send so thick?	Why did you send so many?
Who’s born that day When I forget to send to Antony Shall die a beggar.	Whoever is born on a day I forget to send a message to Antony will die a beggar.
Ink and paper, Charmian.	Bring ink and paper, Charmian.
Welcome, my good Alexas.	Welcome, my good Alexas.
Did I, Charmian, Ever love Caesar so?	Charmian, did I ever love Caesar as much as this?
Oh, that brave Caesar!	Oh, that splendid Caesar!
Be choked with such another emphasis!	May you choke on any other sentiments like that!
Say, “the brave Antony.”                                                 The valiant Caesar!	Say, “That splendid Antony.” The courageous Caesar!
By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth If thou with Caesar paragon again My man of men.	By Isis, I’ll give you bloody teeth if you ever compare Caesar with Antony, my best man among men.
By your most gracious pardon, I sing but after you.	Pardon me, but I’m just repeating what you yourself have said.
My salad days, When I was green in judgment, cold in blood, To say as I said then.	That was when I was young and inexperienced and didn’t know what passion was.
We, ignorant of ourselves, Beg often our own harms, which the wise powers Deny us for our good, so find we profit By losing of our prayers.	In that case, the wise gods deny our prayers for our own good.
I shall do well.	I’ll do well.
The people love me, and the sea is mine.	The people are on my side, and I’m in charge of the sea.
My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope Says it will come to th’ full.	My forces are growing, and everything I know tells me it’s all coming together.
Mark Antony In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make No wars without doors.	Mark Antony is at dinner in Egypt and won’t be going outside to make war.
Caesar gets money where He loses hearts.	Caesar loses supporters wherever he raises money.
Lepidus flatters both, Of both is flattered, but he neither loves, Nor either cares for him.	Lepidus flatters both of them, as they flatter him, but he doesn’t love them, and they don’t love him.
Caesar and Lepidus Are in the field.	Caesar and Lepidus are organizing their military operation.
A mighty strength they carry.	They have a massive army.
Where have you this?	Where did you hear this?
Tis false.	It’s not true.
From Silvius, sir.	From Silvius, sir.
He dreams.	He’s dreaming.
I know they are in Rome together Looking for Antony.	I know they’re in Rome together, hoping for Antony to return.
But all the charms of love, Salt Cleopatra, soften thy wanned lip!	Lecherous Cleopatra, may all the charms of love soften those withered lips!
Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both.	Join your witchcraft with your beauty, and let Antony’s lust combine with both.
Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts, Keep his brain fuming.	Keep this libertine occupied with endless debauchery.
This is most certain that I shall deliver: Mark Antony is every hour in Rome Expected.	This news is absolutely true: Mark Antony is expected to arrive in Rome at any hour now.
Since he went from Egypt ’tis A space for farther travel.	In the time since he left Egypt, he could have traveled an even longer distance.
His soldiership Is twice the other twain.	His military ability is double that of the other two.
But let us rear The higher our opinion, that our stirring Can from the lap of Egypt’s widow pluck The ne’er lust-wearied Antony.	We must form a better opinion of ourselves if our uprising can pull the insatiable Antony’s attention away from that Egyptian widow.
I cannot hope Caesar and Antony shall well greet together.	I don’t expect Caesar and Antony will have a very friendly reunion.
I know not, Menas, How lesser enmities may give way to greater.	Menas, I don’t understand how minor quarrels can be superseded by greater ones.
Be ’t as our gods will have ’t.	It will be as the gods see fit.
It only stands Our lives upon to use our strongest hands.	In any case, our survival depends on putting together the strongest force possible.
Come, Menas.	Let’s go, Menas.
Good Enobarbus, ’tis a worthy deed, And shall become you well, to entreat your captain To soft and gentle speech.	Good Enobarbus, you would be doing a very good thing if you advised your captain to speak calmly and quietly.
I shall entreat him To answer like himself.	I will advise him to speak as he usually does.
By Jupiter, Were I the wearer of Antonio’s beard, I would not shave ’t today.	By Jupiter, if I were Antony, I wouldn’t shave my beard today.
Tis not a time for private stomaching.	This is not the time for dwelling on personal grievances.
But small to greater matters must give way.	But major issues must come before minor ones.
Not if the small come first.	Not if the minor ones come up first.
Here comes the noble Antony.	Here comes the noble Antony.
And yonder, Caesar.	And there comes Caesar.
Tis spoken well.	You’re right.
Were we before our armies, and to fight, I should do thus.	If we were in front of our armies, about to fight, I would do this.
Welcome to Rome.	Welcome to Rome.
Thank you.	Thank you.
Sit.	Have a seat.
Sit, sir.	After you.
Nay, then.	No, after you.
I must be laughed at If or for nothing or a little, I Should say myself offended, and with you Chiefly i’ th’ world; more laughed at, that I should Once name you derogately, when to sound your name It not concerned me.	I should be ridiculed if I were offended so easily—and laughed at even more for speaking of you disrespectfully, when I had no reason to speak of you at all.
My being in Egypt, Caesar, what was ’t to you?	Caesar, what did my stay in Egypt have to do with you?
No more than my residing here at Rome Might be to you in Egypt.	No more than my staying here in Rome might mean to you in Egypt.
Yet if you there Did practice on my state, your being in Egypt Might be my question.	But if you conspired against my position while you were there, I might be interested in the reason for your stay in Egypt.
How intend you, “practiced”?	How do you mean, “conspired”?
You may be pleased to catch at mine intent By what did here befall me.	You can judge for yourself what I mean.
Your wife and brother Made wars upon me, and their contestation Was theme for you.	Your wife and brother led troops against me, claiming to be fighting in your name.
You were the word of war.	They said they were acting for you.
You do mistake your business.	You’re mistaken.
My brother never Did urge me in his act.	My brother didn’t use my name to justify his rebellion.
Did he not rather Discredit my authority with yours, And make the wars alike against my stomach, Having alike your cause?	He rejected my authority as much as yours.
Of this my letters Before did satisfy you.	I’ve already sent the proof in my letters.
If you’ll patch a quarrel, As matter whole you have to make it with, It must not be with this.	If you want to pick a fight, you’ll have to find a more substantial excuse.
You praise yourself By laying defects of judgment to me, but You patched up your excuses.	You defend yourself by blaming my judgment, but you’re just making up feeble excuses.
Not so, not so.	Not true, not true.
I know you could not lack, I am certain on ’t, Very necessity of this thought, that I, Your partner in the cause ’gainst which he fought, Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars Which fronted mine own peace.	You know I would never approve a war against my own cause.
As for my wife, I would you had her spirit in such another.	As for my wife, if only you had such a wife.
The third o’ th’ world is yours, which with a snaffle You may pace easy, but not such a wife.	It’s easier to rule a third of the world than a wife like that.
For that you must But say I could not help it.	But you can’t blame me for her offenses.
I wrote to you When rioting in Alexandria.	I sent you a letter while you were carousing in Alexandria.
Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want Of what I was i’ th’ morning.	I was not myself, as a result of the wine.
But next day I told him of myself, which was as much As to have asked him pardon.	The next day I explained all this to him, which was as good as begging his pardon.
Let this fellow Be nothing of our strife.	Let’s not fight over this fellow.
Hear the ambassadors.	Meet with the ambassadors.
No messenger but thine, and all alone Tonight we’ll wander through the streets and note The qualities of people.	Tonight we’ll wander through the streets and observe the people.
You have broken The article of your oath, which you shall never Have tongue to charge me with.	You will never be able to say the same about me.
Soft, Caesar.	Go on, Caesar.
No, Lepidus, let him speak.	What part of the agreement did I break?
The honor is sacred which he talks on now, Supposing that I lacked it.—But, on, Caesar.	You agreed to send me troops and weapons when I needed them.
The article of my oath?	You refused me both.
To lend me arms and aid when I required them, The which you both denied.	I overlooked your request, but I did not deny it.
Neglected, rather, And then when poisoned hours had bound me up From mine own knowledge.	Your request came at a time when the poisonous effects of reveling caused me to be unaware of my own actions.
Tis noble spoken.	Spoken like a gentleman.
If it might please you to enforce no further The griefs between ye, to forget them quite Were to remember that the present need Speaks to atone you.	If it’s okay with you, you should not press your grievances any further, but realize that the current situation should be enough to reconcile you.
Worthily spoken, Maecenas.	Well put, Maecenas.
Or, if you borrow one another’s love for the instant, you may, when you hear no more words of Pompey, return it again.	Or you can pretend to settle your differences until this matter with Pompey is finished.
You shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.	You can argue as much as you like when there’s nothing else to do.
Thou art a soldier only.	You are only a soldier.
Therefore speak no more.	Don’t speak any further.
Go to, then.	As you please.
Give me leave, Caesar.	May I speak, Caesar.
Speak, Agrippa.	What is it, Agrippa?
Thou hast a sister by the mother’s side, Admired Octavia.	You have a beautiful half-sister, Octavia.
Great Mark Antony Is now a widower.	Great Mark Antony is a widower now.
Say not so, Agrippa.	You’d better not make that suggestion, Agrippa.
If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof Were well deserved of rashness.	If Cleopatra heard you, you would be well punished for your audacity.
I am not married, Caesar.	It’s true I’m not married, Caesar.
Let me hear Agrippa further speak.	Let me hear what Agrippa has to say.
By this marriage, All little jealousies, which now seem great, And all great fears, which now import their dangers, Would then be nothing.	With this marriage, all the petty jealousies that now seem huge, and all the great fears that are dangerous in themselves, would disappear.
Her love to both Would each to other and all loves to both Draw after her.	Since she would love both of you, you two would be joined in that love.
Will Caesar speak?	What do you say, Caesar?
The power of Caesar, and His power unto Octavia.	He has both my power and my influence over Octavia.
May I never To this good purpose, that so fairly shows, Dream of impediment!	I wouldn’t dream of opposing such an obviously promising idea.
There’s my hand.	Here’s my hand.

Caesar’s.	Caesar.
Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side.	So you’d better not stay with him, Antony.
Thy dæmon—that thy spirit which keeps thee—is Noble, courageous, high, unmatchable Where Caesar’s is not.	Your guardian angel is noble, courageous, significant, and unmatched when Caesar’s not around.
But near him thy angel Becomes afeard, as being o’erpowered.	But when you are with him, your angel is weakened and easily frightened.

Why, there’s more gold.	Well then, here’s more money for you.

Bring it to that, The gold I give thee will I melt and pour Down thy ill-uttering throat.	If that’s what you mean, I’ll melt this gold and pour it down your throat that speaks these hateful words.
Good madam, hear me.	Good madam, let me speak.

But were I not the better part made mercy, I should not seek an absent argument Of my revenge, thou present.	If I weren’t a merciful man, I’d forget about your missing brother and punish you in his place.
But look to it: Find out thy brother, wheresoe'er he is.	But do this: find your brother, wherever he is.
Bring him, dead or living, Within this twelvemonth or turn thou no more To seek a living in our territory.	Bring him here dead or alive within the next year, or get out off my land.
Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine Worth seizure, do we seize into our hands Till thou canst quit thee by thy brother’s mouth Of what we think against thee.	I’m seizing your lands and all that you possess until your brother gives testimony that absolves you of any guilt.
Oh, that your Highness knew my heart in this: I never loved my brother in my life.	I wish your Highness knew my true feelings in this matter: I have never in my life loved my brother.
More villain thou.—Well, push him out of doors And let my officers of such a nature Make an extent upon his house and lands.	That makes you an even bigger villain.—Well, throw him out, and have my officers seize his house and lands.

And how like you this shepherd’s life, Master Touchstone?	And you,  And how are you liking the shepherd’s life, Master Touchstone?
Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good life; but in respect that it is a shepherd’s life, it is naught.	Well, in and of itself, it is a good life, but given that it’s a shepherd’s life, it’s worthless.
In respect that it is solitary, I like it very well; but in respect that it is private, it is a very vile life.	In the fact that it’s solitary, I enjoy it very much; but in the sense that it’s private, it’s terrible.
Now in respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in respect it is not in the court, it is tedious.	Now, I’m very pleased with it being outdoors, but in its not being at the court, it is boring.
Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?	Are you any kind of philosopher yourself, shepherd?
Such a one is a natural philosopher.	You’re a natural-born philosopher!
Wast ever in court, shepherd?	Were you ever at court, shepherd?
No, truly.	Honestly, no.
Then thou art damned.	Then you are damned.
Nay, I hope.	I hope not.
Your reason.	Explain.
Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never saw’st good manners; if thou never saw’st good manners, then thy manners must be wicked, and wickedness is sin, and sin is damnation.	Well, if you were never at court, you were never exposed to good manners; if you never witnessed good manners, your manners must be wicked; wickedness is a sin, and committing sins leads to damnation.
Thou art in a parlous state, shepherd.	You are in a perilous state, shepherd.
Not a whit, Touchstone.	Not at all, Touchstone.
Those that are good manners at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the behavior of the country is most mockable at the court.	The good manners of the court look as silly in the country as country behavior is laughable at the court.
You told me you salute not at the court but you kiss your hands.	You told me that you don’t salute at the court but kiss hands.
That courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds.	Now, if courtiers were shepherds, that kind of courtesy would be unclean.
Instance, briefly.	Give a quick example.
Come, instance.	Come, explain.
Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their fells, you know, are greasy.	Why, because we’re always handling our ewes, and their fleece, as you know, is greasy.
Why, do not your courtier’s hands sweat?	What, don’t courtiers' hands sweat?
And is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man?	And isn’t a sheep’s grease as wholesome as a man’s sweat?
A better instance, I say.	That’s a poor example.
Come.	A better example—come on.
Besides, our hands are hard.	Besides, our hands are hard and calloused.
Your lips will feel them the sooner.	Then your lips will feel them more quickly.
Come.	Come on.
Most shallow man.	You worthless man!
Thou worms' meat in respect of a good piece of flesh, indeed.	You are about as much of a thinker as worm’s meat is a nice steak.
Learn of the wise and perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the very uncleanly flux of a cat.	Learn from the wise, and comprehend: the courtier’s perfume is made from cat discharge—much more disgusting than tar.
Mend the instance, shepherd.	Fix your example, shepherd.
You have too courtly a wit for me.	Your wit is too courtly for me.
I’ll rest.	I’ll rest now.
Good morrow to your Worship.	Good morning, sir.
Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke’s daughter, be banished with her father?	Can you tell me whether Rosalind, Duke Senior’s daughter, has also been banished?
Where will the old duke live?	Where will the old duke live?
Wilt thou rest damned?	You’re going to rest while you’re still damned?
God help thee, shallow man.	God help you, foolish man.
God make incision in thee; thou art raw.	Pray God does some surgery on you: you need to be fixed.
That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes and the rams together and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a bellwether and to betray a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to a crooked-pated old cuckoldly ram, out of all reasonable match.	That’s another sin arising from your ignorance: you bring ewes and rams together and make your living by their copulation.

I’ll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners and suppers and sleeping hours excepted.	I could rhyme like that for eight years in a row, excepting meal times and sleeping hours.
It is the right butter-women’s rank to market.	That awful, plodding rhyme sounded like a row of dairy women stomping off to market.
Out, fool.	Oh, stop, fool.
For a taste: If a hart do lack a hind, Let him seek out Rosalind.	Let me try: If there’s a buck who needs a doe Tell him Rosalind will do.
If the cat will after kind, So, be sure, will Rosalind.	A cat in heat will look for a mate, And Rosalind certainly will too.
Winter garments must be lined, So must slender Rosalind.	Winter garments need to be filled with something, And so does skinny Rosalind.
They that reap must sheaf and bind, Then to cart with Rosalind.	After you harvest, you have to sheaf and bind So throw ripe Rosalind on the harvest cart.
Sweetest nut hath sourest rind; Such a nut is Rosalind.	The sweetest nut has the sourest rind And Rosalind is that kind of nut.
He that sweetest rose will find Must find love’s prick, and Rosalind.	The man who finds the sweetest rose Will be pricked by it, and by Rosalind.
This is the very false gallop of verses.	This is exactly the false way that verses gallop along.
Why do you infect yourself with them?	Why bother with them?
Peace, you dull fool.	Quiet, you stupid fool.
I found them on a tree.	I found them on a tree.
Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.	Well, the tree bears rotten fruit.
You have said, but whether wisely or no, let the forest judge.	All right, you’ve had your say, but we’ll let the forest judge whether or not you spoke wisely.
Peace.	Quiet!
But upon the fairest boughs, Or at every sentence end, Will I “Rosalinda” write, Teaching all that read to know The quintessence of every sprite Heaven would in little show.	But on the prettiest branches Or at the end of every sentence  I’ll write “Rosalinda,” Teaching everyone who can read that the essence of every spirit Is contained in this one woman.

Nature presently distilled Helen’s cheek, but not her heart, Cleopatra’s majesty, Atalanta’s better part, Sad Lucretia’s modesty.	Nature took Helen’s  Cleopatra’s majesty, The best of Atalanta, And unhappy Lucretia’s modesty.
Thus Rosalind of many parts By heavenly synod was devised, Of many faces, eyes, and hearts To have the touches dearest prized.	So, by heaven’s decree, Rosalind Was composed Of different faces, eyes, and hearts, so that she might have the most prized touches of all.
Heaven would that she these gifts should have And I to live and die her slave.	Heaven wanted Rosalind to have these gifts And me to live and die as her slave.
Didst thou hear these verses?	Were you listening to these verses?
Oh, yes, I heard them all, and more too, for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear.	Oh yes, I heard them all, and more, too.
Ay, but the feet were lame and could not bear themselves without the verse, and therefore stood lamely in the verse.	Some of those lines had more feet than the  That’s not a problem: the feet can bear Sure, but these feet were
But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be hanged and carved upon these trees?	But did you listen to all that poetry without even wondering about what your name is doing on all these trees?

Nay, but who is it?	No, who are you talking about?
Is it possible?	Is it possible?
Nay, I prithee now, with most petitionary vehemence, tell me who it is.	No, I’m begging you now, tell me who it is.

I found him under a tree like a dropped acorn.	I found Orlando under a tree, like a dropped acorn.

Marry, do I, sir, and I came to acquaint you with a matter.	Indeed I do, sir, and I’ve come to let you in on a certain problem.
I am given, sir, secretly to understand that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition to come in disguised against me to try a fall.	I’ve been informed by certain sources I can’t disclose that your younger brother Orlando plans to fight me in disguise.
Tomorrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit, and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well.	Tomorrow, sir, I’m fighting for my reputation, and any man who gets away without a broken bone or two is an exceptional wrestler indeed.
Your brother is but young and tender, and, for your love I would be loath to foil him, as I must for my own honor if he come in.	Your brother is young and inexperienced, and because of my affection for you, I’d hate to crush him—though I’d have to, if he challenged me.
Therefore, out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you withal, that either you might stay him from his intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into, in that it is a thing of his own search and altogether against my will.	I’m telling you all this out of affection for you, so you can either keep him from carrying out his plans or prepare to accept his disgrace, which will be his own fault, not mine.
Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which thou shalt find I will most kindly requite.	Charles, I thank you for your loyalty to me, and you’ll see that I’ll reward you.
I had myself notice of my brother’s purpose herein and have by underhand means labored to dissuade him from it; but he is resolute.	I’d heard about my brother’s plan and have been subtly trying to change his mind, but he’s determined.
I’ll tell thee, Charles: it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full of ambition, an envious emulator of every man’s good parts, a secret and villainous contriver against me his natural brother.	I tell you, Charles, he’s the stubbornest young fellow in France: overly ambitious, jealous of other people’s good qualities, and a traitor against me, his own blood brother.

I had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger.	I’d be just as happy if you broke his neck as his finger.
I speak but brotherly of him, but should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must blush and weep, and thou must look pale and wonder.	But if I really laid him bare, I’d have to weep and hang my head, and you would not believe me, his behavior is so shocking.
And why not the swift foot of time?	Why didn’t you say “the swift steps” of time instead of the “lazy foot”?

But indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was in his youth an inland man, one that knew courtship too well, for there he fell in love.	Actually, an old religious uncle of mine taught me how to speak, and he was brought up in the city.
I have heard him read many lectures against it, and I thank God I am not a woman, to be touched with so many giddy offenses as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal.	Thank God I’m not a woman and afflicted with all the giddiness that troubles that entire sex.
Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women?	What were the primary evils he claimed women were guilty of?
There were none principal.	There were no primary ones.
I prithee, recount some of them.	Please, tell me some of them.
No, I will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick.	No, I won’t give my medicine away to anyone but the sick.
There is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving “Rosalind” on their barks, hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of Rosalind.	There’s a man haunting this forest who abuses the trees by carving “Rosalind” on their barks.
I am he that is so love-shaked.	Well, I’m the man you’re speaking of.
I pray you tell me your remedy.	Please, tell me your cure.
There is none of my uncle’s marks upon you.	But you don’t have any of the symptoms my uncle told me about.
He taught me how to know a man in love, in which cage of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.	He taught me how to recognize a man in love, and you’re not a prisoner of love, I’m sure.
What were his marks?	What did he say the symptoms were?
A lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken, which you have not; an unquestionable spirit, which you have not; a beard neglected, which you have not—but I pardon you for that, for simply your having in beard is a younger brother’s revenue.	A thin face, which you don’t have; a sleepless, sunken eye, which you don’t have; an irritable temper, which you don’t have; a neglected beard, which you don’t have—but that might not be so telling, since you don’t have much beard anyway.
Then your hose should be ungartered, your bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe untied, and everything about you demonstrating a careless desolation.	Your stockings should be falling down around your ankles, your hat flying off your head, your sleeves unbuttoned, your shoes untied, and everything about you demonstrating carelessness and misery.
But you are no such man.	But you’re no such man.
You are rather point-device in your accouterments, as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.	You’re so neat and well put-together that you look like you love yourself more than anyone else.
Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.	Young boy, I wish I could make you believe that I’m in love.
Me believe it?	Make me believe it?
But, in good sooth, are you he that hangs the verses on the trees wherein Rosalind is so admired?	But really, are you the one who’s been hanging on the trees those poems that speak so admiringly of Rosalind?
I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.	I swear to you by Rosalind’s own pretty hand that I am that unfortunate man.
But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?	Are you really as in love as your poems declare?
Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.	Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much I love her.
Love is merely a madness and, I tell you, deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do, and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love, too.	The only reason they don’t get punished and cured is that the disease is so commonplace that the nuthouse nurses are usually suffering from it, too.
Yet I profess curing it by counsel.	But I promise it can be cured with some guidance.
Did you ever cure any so?	Have you ever cured anyone this way before?
Yes, one, and in this manner.	Yes, one, and this is how I did it.
I would not be cured, youth.	I don’t want to be cured, boy.
I would cure you if you would but call me Rosalind and come every day to my cote and woo me.	I could cure you, if you just called me Rosalind and came by my cottage every day to woo me.
Now, by the faith of my love, I will.	By my faith in love, I will, then.
Tell me where it is.	Tell me where you live.
Go with me to it, and I’ll show it you; and by the way you shall tell me where in the forest you live.	Come with me, I’ll show you, and along the way, you can tell me where you live.
Will you go?	Will you come?
With all my heart, good youth.	Wholeheartedly, good young man.
Nay, you must call me Rosalind.—Come, sister, will you go?	No, you have to call me Rosalind.—Sister, you’re coming?
Come apace, good Audrey.	Come on, sweet Audrey.
I will fetch up your goats, Audrey.	I’ll get your goats, Audrey.
Doth my simple feature content you?	Do my simple features please you?
Your features, Lord warrant us!	Your features, God help us!
What features?	What features?
Truly, I would the gods had made thee poetical.	Really, Audrey, I wish you were more poetical.
I do not know what “poetical” is.	I don’t know what “poetical” means.
Is it honest in deed and word?	Is it “chaste in word and action”?
Is it a true thing?	Does it mean being truthful?
No, truly, for the truest poetry is the most feigning, and lovers are given to poetry, and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.	Not really, for the truest poetry is often the most artificial.
Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?	But you still wish the gods had made me poetical?
I do, truly, for thou swear’st to me thou art honest.	I do, in fact.
Now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some hope thou didst feign.	Right now you swear to me that you are a virgin; if you were a poet, I might have some hope you were lying.
Would you not have me honest?	What, you don’t want me to be chaste?
No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favored, for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.	Not really, unless you were ugly.
Well, I am not fair, and therefore I pray the gods make me honest.	Well, I’m not beautiful, so I hope that I can at least be chaste.
I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.	I’m not a slut—I keep myself clean—but I thank God I am ugly.
Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness; sluttishness may come hereafter.	Well, praise the Lord you’re ugly.
But what though?	Well, God bless this marriage!
Courage.	Amen.
Well, that is the dowry of his wife; ’tis none of his own getting.	Well, that’s what the wife brings to the marriage.
Horns?	Horns?
Even so.	Well, there they are.
Poor men alone?	Only for poor men?
No, no.	No, no.
The noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal.	The nobleman’s are as huge as the underfed villager’s.
Is the single man therefore blessed?	Is the single man lucky, then?
No.	No.
As a walled town is more worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a married man more honorable than the bare brow of a bachelor.	Just as a town protected by a wall around it is worth more than a low-lying village, a married man’s horned forehead is more honorable than a bachelor’s bare forehead.
Here comes Sir Oliver.—Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met.	Here comes Sir Oliver.
Will you dispatch us here under this tree, or shall we go with you to your chapel?	Will you marry us here, under this tree, or should we follow you to your chapel?
Is there none here to give the woman?	Is there anyone to give the bride away?
I will not take her on gift of any man.	I don’t want to take another man’s second-hand goods.
Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.	No, someone has to give her away or the marriage isn’t legal.
How do you, sir?	How are you, sir?
You are very well met.	We’re glad to see you.
God 'ild you for your last company.	God bless you for being here.
I am very glad to see you.	I’m very glad to see you.
Even a toy in hand here, sir.	This is just a trifling matter here, sir.
Nay, pray be covered.	No, no, put your hat back on.
Will you be married, motley?	Do you want to get married, fool?
As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb, and the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.	Just as the ox has his yoke, the horse its bridle, the falcon a tether, a man has his desires—to keep in check.
And will you, being a man of your breeding, be married under a bush like a beggar?	And, being a man of your breeding, you’re going to be married under some shrubs like a beggar?
Get you to church, and have a good priest that can tell you what marriage is.	Get yourself to a church and have a proper priest, who can tell you what marriage is all about, marry you.
Then one of you will prove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp, warp.	Then one of you will warp and pull away—and there goes your marriage.
Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.	Come with me and let me advise you.
Come, sweet Audrey.	Come, sweet Audrey.
We must be married, or we must live in bawdry.—Farewell, good Master Oliver, not               'Tis no matter.	We have to be married properly.
Ne'er a fantastical knave of them all shall flout me out of my calling.	None of these deranged rascals can shake me from my profession.
Never talk to me.	Don’t talk to me.
I will weep.	I’m going to cry.
Do, I prithee, but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a man.	Go ahead if you want, but remember that crying doesn’t suit a man.
But have I not cause to weep?	But don’t I have good reason to cry?
As good cause as one would desire.	As good a reason as any.
Therefore weep.	So go ahead and cry.
And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread.	His kiss is as holy as bread blessed by a priest.
I am heartily glad I came hither to you.	I’m very glad I came to see you.
If he come tomorrow, I’ll give him his payment.	If he shows up tomorrow, I’ll give him what’s coming to him.
If ever he go alone again, I’ll never wrestle for prize more.	If he can manage to walk after our fight, I’ll never wrestle for money again.
Farewell, good Charles.	Farewell, my lord.
But it shall not be so long; this wrestler shall clear all.	But not for long; Charles will take care of everything.
You have heard him swear downright he was.	But you heard him swear up and down that he was.
He attends here in the forest on the duke your father.	He’s staying in the forest with your father now.
I met the duke yesterday and had much question with him.	I met my father in the woods yesterday and had a long conversation with him.
So he laughed and let me go.	He laughed at that and let me go.
But what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as Orlando?	He writes brave poems, speaks brave words, makes brave promises, and then breaks them just as bravely.
Oh, that’s a brave man.	He’s like a cowardly
Who comes here?	Who’s coming here?
Mistress and master, you have oft inquired After the shepherd that complained of love, Who you saw sitting by me on the turf, Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess That was his mistress.	Mistress and master, you’ve often asked about that lovelorn shepherd you once saw me sitting with, the one who complained about the disdainful shepherdess he was in love with.
The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.	Yes, what about him?
Sweet Phoebe, do not scorn me.	Sweet Phoebe, do not scorn me.
Do not, Phoebe.	Do not, Phoebe.
Say that you love me not, but say not so In bitterness.	Go ahead and say you don’t love me, but not so bitterly.
Now counterfeit to swoon, why, now fall down; Or if thou canst not, Oh, for shame, for shame, Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers.	Faint, fall down—if you don’t, then you’re lying about my eyes being murderers.
Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee.	Come on, show me the wound that my eyes have caused.
But now mine eyes, Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not.	But my eyes, which I’ve darted at you, haven’t even left a mark.
Nor, I am sure, there is no force in eyes That can do hurt.	Now I am sure that eyes can’t hurt a person.
O dear Phoebe, If ever—as that ever may be near— You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy, Then shall you know the wounds invisible That love’s keen arrows make.	Oh, darling Phoebe, if you ever fall in love with some fresh face, then you’ll know about the invisible wounds that love’s sharp arrows can make.
But till that time Come not thou near me.	Well, until that time, don’t come near me.
And when that time comes, Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not, As till that time I shall not pity thee.	And when that time comes, then you can mock me, but please don’t pity me, because I won’t pity you.
But, mistress, know yourself.	But mistress, know yourself.
Down on your knees And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man’s love, For I must tell you friendly in your ear, Sell when you can; you are not for all markets.	Get down on your knees and thank heaven for sending you such a good man.
Cry the man mercy, love him, take his offer.	Ask this man’s forgiveness, love him, and accept his offer.
So take her to thee, shepherd.	So take her, shepherd, and God bless you.
Besides, I like you not.	Besides, I don’t like you.
Will you go, sister?—Shepherd, ply her hard.	Come on, sister.
Come, sister.—Shepherdess, look on him better, And be not proud.	And don’t be proud.
Though all the world could see, None could be so abused in sight as he.	The whole world could look at you, and no one would be as blind as he is, thinking you’re beautiful.
Sweet Phoebe, pity me.	Sweet Phoebe, have pity on me.
Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.	Well, I’m sorry for you, gentle Silvius.
If you do sorrow at my grief in love, By giving love your sorrow and my grief Were both extermined.	Then both my grief and your sorrow will be cured.
Thou hast my love.	You have my friendship.
Is not that neighborly?	Isn’t that enough?
I would have you.	I want you.
Why, that were covetousness.	Well, that’s just greedy.
But do not look for further recompense Than thine own gladness that thou art employed.	But don’t expect any more than that.
Know’st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile?	Do you know the boy who was just speaking to me?
Not very well, but I have met him oft, And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds That the old carlot once was master of.	Not very well, but I’ve met him several times.
Think not I love him, though I ask for him.	Don’t think I’m in love with him just because I’m asking about him.
Tis but a peevish boy—yet he talks well— But what care I for words?	But what do I care about words?
Yet words do well When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.	And yet, words are a good thing when the man speaking them is pleasant to listen to.
It is a pretty youth—not very pretty— But sure he’s proud—and yet his pride becomes him.	He’s awfully proud, but his pride suits him.
He’ll make a proper man.	He’ll grow up to be a proper man.
He is not very tall—yet for his years he’s tall.	He’s not very tall, but he’s tall enough for his age.
His leg is but so-so—and yet ’tis well.	His legs aren’t great, but they’re alright.
There was a pretty redness in his lip, A little riper and more lusty red Than that mixed in his cheek: ’twas just the difference Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask.	His lips were nice and red, a little more lively and passionate than the red that was in his cheeks—one was pure red and the other more pink.
For what had he to do to chide at me?	What right did he have to scold me like that?
He said mine eyes were black and my hair black And, now I am remembered, scorned at me.	He said my eyes and my hair were black and, now that I think of it, he scorned me.
I marvel why I answered not again.	I’m surprised I didn’t bite back.
But that’s all one: omittance is no quittance.	But no matter—I’ll get back at him soon enough.
I’ll write to him a very taunting letter, And thou shalt bear it.	I’ll write him a taunting letter, and you can deliver it.
Wilt thou, Silvius?	Will you do that for me, Silvius?
Phoebe, with all my heart.	With all my heart, Phoebe.
I will be bitter with him and passing short.	I’ll be bitter toward him, and curt.
Go with me, Silvius.	Come with me, Silvius.
I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted with thee.	Please, pretty young man, I’d like to get to know you better.
They say you are a melancholy fellow.	They say you are a melancholy fellow.
I am so.	I am.
I do love it better than laughing.	I like it better than laughing.
Those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards.	People who are either too serious or too silly are awful.
Why, ’tis good to be sad and say nothing.	Well, I think it’s good to be serious and keep quiet.
Why then, ’tis good to be a post.	In that case it’s good to be a post.
I have neither the scholar’s melancholy, which is emulation; nor the musician’s, which is fantastical; nor the courtier’s, which is proud; nor the soldier’s, which is ambitious; nor the lawyer’s, which is politic; nor the lady’s, which is nice; nor the lover’s, which is all these, but it is a melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples, extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels, in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness.	I don’t have the proud melancholy of a courtier or the ambitious melancholy of a soldier or the calculated melancholy of a lawyer.
A traveler.	You’re a traveler.
By my faith, you have great reason to be sad.	Well then, you have good reason to be sad.
I fear you have sold your own lands to see other men’s.	I’m afraid you’ve sold your own land to see other men’s.
Then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands.	To have seen much but own nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands.
Yes, I have gained my experience.	Not true.
And your experience makes you sad.	And your experience makes you sad.
I had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad— and to travel for it, too.	I’d rather have a jester to make me happy than experience to make me sad—and to travel for all that trouble, no less!
Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind.	Good day and happiness to you, darling Rosalind.
My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.	My beautiful Rosalind, I’m only an hour late.
I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.	Please, Rosalind, my sweet cousin—be happy.
Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of, and would you yet I were merrier?	Dear Celia—I already look much happier than I feel, but you want me to look even happier?
Unless you could teach me to forget a banished father, you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.	Unless you can also teach me how to forget my banished father, you shouldn’t try to teach me how to be happy.
Herein I see thou lov’st me not with the full weight that I love thee.	Well, by this I can see that you don’t love me as much as I love you.
Well, I will forget the condition of my estate to rejoice in yours.	If  Well, I’ll just forget the difficulties of my situation, in order to focus on the happiness of yours.
By mine honor I will, and when I break that oath, let me turn monster.	I swear I will, and if I ever break my promise let me turn into a monster.
Therefore, my sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.	So please, my sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be happy.
From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports.	From now on I will, cousin, and I’ll think of all kinds of games for us.
Let me see—what think you of falling in love?	Let me see—what do you think about falling in love?
Break an hour’s promise in love?	You’d break a date with your beloved by a whole hour?
Pardon me, dear Rosalind.	Forgive me, darling Rosalind.
Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight.	No, if you’re ever late like this again, I’ll refuse to see you.
I had as lief be wooed of a snail.	I’d rather be wooed by a snail.
Of a snail?	A snail?
Besides, he brings his destiny with him.	Besides, he brings his fate with him.
What’s that?	What fate is that?
Why, horns, which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for.	Why, his cuckold’s horns, of course—the kind you men are always blaming on your wives.
But he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife.	See, the snail already has its horns, which prevents nasty rumors from spreading about his wife’s infidelity.
Virtue is no hornmaker, and my Rosalind is virtuous.	A virtuous woman won’t give her husband horns, and my Rosalind is definitely virtuous.
And I am your Rosalind.	And I am your Rosalind.
Rosalind of a better leer than you.	Come on, woo me, woo me.
Come, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday humor, and like enough to consent.	I’m in a good mood now and likely to give you what you want.
What would you say to me now, an I were your very, very Rosalind?	What would you say to me now if I really were your precious little Rosalind?
I would kiss before I spoke.	I’d kiss you before I spoke.
Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were graveled for lack of matter, you might take occasion to kiss.	No, it would be better to speak first and kiss only after you’ve run out of things to say.
Very good orators, when they are out, they will spit; and for lovers lacking—God warn us—matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss.	When good orators finish talking, they spit; when lovers do (God help us if they ever do), they kiss.
How if the kiss be denied?	What if she won’t kiss me?
Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?	Who could be out of things to say if he were with the girl he loves?
Marry, that should you if I were your mistress, or I should think my honesty ranker than my wit.	Indeed, you would be out if I were your mistress—if my chastity is worth as much as my wit.
Am not I your Rosalind?	Aren’t I your Rosalind?
I take some joy to say you are because I would be talking of her.	I like to pretend you are, because then it’s almost like actually talking to her.
No, faith, die by attorney.	No, you won’t die yourself, but only by proxy.
The poor world is almost six thousand years old, and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person, videlicet, in a love cause.	This world is almost six thousand years old, and in all this time not one man has ever actually died from love.
Then love me, Rosalind.	Then love me, Rosalind.
Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.	Okay, I will—on Fridays and Saturdays, and the rest.
And wilt thou have me?	And will you have me?
Ay, and twenty such.	Sure, and twenty others just like you.
What sayest thou?	What’s that?
Are you not good?	Well, aren’t you a good man?
I hope so.	I hope so.
Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?— Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.—Give me your hand, Orlando.—What do you say, sister?	And can a person ever have too much of a good thing?—Come on, sister, you can be the priest and marry us.—Give me your hand, Orlando.—What do you say, sister?
Pray thee, marry us.	Please, marry us.
I will.	I do.
Ay, but when?	Okay, but when?
Why, now, as fast as she can marry us.	Right now; as fast as she can say the vows.
Then you must say “I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.” I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.	Then you have to say, “I take you, Rosalind, to be my lawfully wedded wife.” I take you, Rosalind, to be my lawfully wedded wife.
I might ask you for your commission, but I do take thee, Orlando, for my husband.	Maybe I should ask you what right you have to take me, but I’ll take you, Orlando, to be my husband.
So do all thoughts.	So do all thoughts.
They are winged.	They have wings.
Now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her.	Now tell me how long you intend to keep her.
Forever and a day.	Forever and a day.
Say “a day” without the “ever.” No, no, Orlando, men are April when they woo, December when they wed. Maids are May when they are maids, but the sky changes when they are wives.	No, Orlando, men are like April when they’re wooing a girl—young, and passionate—but like December once they’re married and their passions have cooled.
I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock- pigeon over his hen, more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more newfangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires than a monkey.	I’ll be more jealous of you than a wild rooster over his hen; more noisy than a parrot chattering about the rain; more fond of new things than an ape; more giddy about getting what I want than a monkey.
I will weep for nothing, like Diana in the fountain, and I will do that when you are disposed to be merry.	I’ll cry at nothing, and I’ll always do it when you’re in a good mood.
I will laugh like a hyena, and that when thou art inclined to sleep.	And when you want to go to sleep, I’ll be up laughing like a hyena.
But will my Rosalind do so?	But will my Rosalind do this, too?
Oh, but she is wise.	But she is wise.
Or else she could not have the wit to do this.	Right.
The wiser, the waywarder.	The wiser the woman, the wilder.
Make the doors upon a woman’s wit, and it will out at the casement.	If you close the doors on a woman’s wit, it’ll fly out the window.
Shut that, and ’twill out at the keyhole.	If you shut the windows, it will pour out the keyhole.
Stop that, ’twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney.	If you stop up the keyhole, it will escape from the chimney along with the smoke.
A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say “Wit, whither wilt?”  Nay, you might keep that check for it, till you met your wife’s wit going to your neighbor’s bed.	A man with a wife like that might ask, “Hey, wandering wit, where are you off to?” Nah, better save the questions for when you find her in your neighbor’s bed.
You shall never take her without her answer unless you take her without her tongue.	You’ll never find her without an answer unless you find her without a tongue.
Oh, that woman that cannot make her fault her husband’s occasion, let her never nurse her child herself, for she will breed it like a fool.	A woman who doesn’t know how to make her own indiscretions look like her husband’s fault is hardly a woman.
For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.	Rosalind, I have to leave you for two hours.
I must attend the duke at dinner.	I must join the duke for lunch.
By two o'clock I will be with thee again.	I’ll be back here with you by two o'clock.
Ay, go your ways, go your ways.	Oh, go, leave me.
I knew what you would prove.	I knew you’d turn out this way.
My friends told me as much, and I thought no less.	My friends told me as much, and I knew it, too.
Tis but one cast away, and so, come, death.	So, take me, death!
Two o'clock is your hour?	You’ll be back at two o'clock?
Ay, sweet Rosalind.	Yes, sweet Rosalind.
Therefore beware my censure, and keep your promise.	So beware of my contempt, and keep your promise.
With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my Rosalind.	I’ll keep my promise just as if you really were Rosalind.
So, adieu.	So, goodbye.
Well, time is the old justice that examines all such offenders, and let time try.	Well, time is the old judge that tries your kind of criminal.
Adieu.	Goodbye.
You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate.	You have absolutely abused our sex in this love talk of yours.
We must have your doublet and hose plucked over your head and show the world what the bird hath done to her own nest.	We should rip off your man’s clothing and show the world the woman who has represented her own kind so badly.
O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst know how many fathom deep I am in love.	Oh cousin, cousin, cousin, my sweet little cousin, I wish you knew how deep in love I am.
Or rather bottomless, that as fast as you pour affection in, it runs out.	Or it’s bottomless, at least: pour affection in one end, and it runs out the other.
No, that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot of thought, conceived of spleen, and born of madness, that blind rascally boy that abuses everyone’s eyes because his own are out, let him be judge how deep I am in love.	Cupid—that blind bastard son of Venus, conceived from a thought and anger, born from insanity, that blind, naughty boy who makes everyone else go blind just because he can’t see himself—let Cupid judge how deep my love runs.
I’ll tell thee, Aliena, I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando.	I’m telling you, Aliena, I can’t stand being apart from Orlando.
I’ll go find a shadow and sigh till he come.	I’m going to find some shade and sigh until he returns.
And I’ll sleep.	And I’m going to sleep.
Which is he that killed the deer?	Which one of you killed the deer?
Yes, sir.	Yes, sir.
Sing it.	Then sing it.
Tis no matter how it be in tune, so it make noise enough.	It doesn’t matter if it’s in tune so long as it’s loud enough.
How say you now?	What do you say now?
Is it not past two o'clock?	Isn’t it past two o'clock?
And here much Orlando.	And I see a lot of Orlando here.
Look who comes here.	Look who’s coming.
No, I protest, I know not the contents.	No, I swear, I don’t even know what’s in it.
Phoebe did write it.	Phoebe wrote it.
What shall be our sport, then?	Well, then, what should we do for fun instead?
Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.	Let’s go find that hussy, Fortune, and and mock her till she starts distributing her gifts more equally.
No?	Oh, really?
When Nature hath made a fair creature, may she not by Fortune fall into the fire?	Well, when Nature makes a person beautiful, can’t Fortune make her fall into a fire, thereby making her ugly after all?
Though Nature hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?	And even though Nature has given us the wit to have this argument, hasn’t Fortune sent this fool here to stop us?
Come, come, you are a fool, And turned into the extremity of love.	Come on, you’re a fool, and driven to extreme measures by love.
I say she never did invent this letter.	The point is that she didn’t write this letter.
This is a man’s invention, and his hand.	These are a man’s words, and his handwriting.
Sure it is hers.	I’m telling you, it’s hers.
Why, she defies me Like Turk to Christian.	Why, she challenges me like a Muslim would challenge a Christian.
Women’s gentle brain Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention, Such Ethiop words, blacker in their effect Than in their countenance.	No, a woman’s gentle brain could never have come up with such crude expressions and even harsher meanings.
Will you hear the letter?	Do you want to hear what she says?
So please you, for I never heard it yet, Yet heard too much of Phoebe’s cruelty.	If you want to read it, as I haven’t heard it yet, though I’ve heard too much of Phoebe’s cruelty.
She Phoebes me.	She’s Phoebe-ing me.
Mark how the tyrant writes.	Listen to what the tyrant says.
That a maiden’s heart hath burned?	You call that ranting?
Call you this railing?	You call this sneering?
Why, thy godhead laid apart, Warr’st thou with a woman’s heart?	Why do you pity him?
Not to be endured.	Follow them straight to the cottage.
It is no boast, being asked, to say we are.	Since you asked, I suppose it’s not bragging to say that we are.
Orlando doth commend him to you both, And to that youth he calls his Rosalind He sends this bloody napkin.	Orlando sends his regards to you both, and he sends this bloody handkerchief to the boy he calls “his Rosalind.” Is that you?
Are you he?	It is.
Some of my shame, if you will know of me What man I am, and how, and why, and where This handkercher was stained.	It’s about who I am, and how, why, and where this handkerchief was stained.
I pray you, tell it.	Please, tell us.
He threw his eye aside— And mark what object did present itself: Under an old oak, whose boughs were mossed with age And high top bald with dry antiquity, A wretched, ragged man, o'ergrown with hair, Lay sleeping on his back.	He looked to the side, and pay attention to what he saw then: under an oak tree—whose lower branches were mossy with age and top branches ancient and brittle—he saw a wretched beggar, with overgrown hair and beard, asleep on his back.
This seen, Orlando did approach the man And found it was his brother, his elder brother.	He discovered that the man was his older brother.
Oh, I have heard him speak of that same brother, And he did render him the most unnatural That lived amongst men.	Oh, I’ve heard him talk about that brother, and he described him as the most inhumane man alive.
But to Orlando: did he leave him there, Food to the sucked and hungry lioness?	He turned away twice and almost left him there.
Twice did he turn his back and purposed so, But kindness, nobler ever than revenge, And nature, stronger than his just occasion, Made him give battle to the lioness, Who quickly fell before him; in which hurtling, From miserable slumber I awaked.	But his kindness was nobler than even his desire for revenge, his natural goodness was stronger than his need to give his brother what he deserved.
Are you his brother?	Are you his brother?
Was ’t you he rescued?	Was it you that he rescued?
Was ’t you that did so oft contrive to kill him?	Was it you that was always plotting to kill him?
Twas I, but ’tis not I. I do not shame To tell you what I was, since my conversion So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.	That was me, but it’s not me— I’m not ashamed to tell you what I once was, since I’m so happy to have since converted.
But for the bloody napkin?	But what about the bloody handkerchief?
By and by.	I’ll get there.
Brief, I recovered him, bound up his wound, And after some small space, being strong at heart,	After a brief time—as he is a strong, brave man—
Many will swoon when they do look on blood.	Many people faint when they see blood.
There is more in it.—Cousin Ganymede.	There’s more to it than that.—Ganymede!
Look, he recovers.	Look, he’s recovering.
I would I were at home.	I want to go home.
We’ll lead you thither.	We’ll take you there.
I pray you, will you take him by the arm?	Please, will you take his arm?
Be of good cheer, youth.	Buck up, boy!
You a man?	You’re a man?
You lack a man’s heart.	You don’t have a man’s courage.
I do so, I confess it.	It’s true, I confess.
Ah, sirrah, a body would think this was well-counterfeited.	Oh, sir, someone would think I was a good fake.
I pray you tell your brother how well I counterfeited.	Please tell your brother what a convincing show I put on.
Heigh-ho.	Whoo-hoo!
This was not counterfeit.	That was no show.
There is too great testimony in your complexion that it was a passion of earnest.	Your cheeks are too flushed for me to believe that was a fake faint.
Counterfeit, I assure you.	Fake, I’m telling you.
Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.	Well, then, be brave and pretend to be a man.
So I do.	That’s what I’m doing.
But i' faith, I should have been a woman by right.	But honestly, I should have been a woman.
Come, you look paler and paler.	Come on, you keep getting paler.
That will I, for I must bear answer back How you excuse my brother, Rosalind.	I’ll do that, because I have to tell my brother how you forgave him, Rosalind.
I shall devise something.	I’ll think of something.
But I pray you commend my counterfeiting to him.	But please, tell him how well I faked a faint.
Will you go?	Will you come with us?
We shall find a time, Audrey.	We’ll get married at some point, Audrey.
Patience, gentle Audrey.	Be patient.
Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old gentleman’s saying.	Really, the priest was good enough, no matter what that old guy said.
A most wicked Sir Oliver, Audrey, a most vile Martext.	No, he was wicked and vile.
But, Audrey, there is a youth here in the forest lays claim to you.	But Audrey, there’s a boy in the forest who claims you’re his girl.
Here comes the man you mean.	Here comes the man himself.
It is meat and drink to me to see a clown.	It warms my heart to encounter such a country bumpkin.
How old are you, friend?	How old are you, friend?
Five-and-twenty, sir.	Twenty-five, sir.
A ripe age.	A mature age.
Is thy name William?	Is your name William?
William, sir.	Yes, it’s William, sir.
A fair name.	A good name.
Wast born i' th' forest here?	Were you born here in the forest?
Ay, sir, I thank God.	Yes sir, thank God.
Thank God.” A good answer.	Thank God”—that’s a good answer.
Art rich?	Are you rich?
Faith, sir, so-so.	Well, so-so.
So-so” is good, very good, very excellent good.	So-so” is good, very good, an excellent answer.
And yet it is not: it is but so-so.	And then again, it’s not so good, but only so-so.
Art thou wise?	Are you wise?
Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.	Yes sir, I’m fairly witty.
Why, thou sayst well.	Well, that’s a fine answer.
Give me your hand.	Give me your hand.
Art thou learned?	Are you educated?
No, sir.	No, sir.
Then learn this of me: to have is to have.	Then learn this from me: if you have something, you have it.
For it is a figure in rhetoric that drink, being poured out of a cup into a glass, by filling the one doth empty the other.	Everyone knows that when you pour a drink out of a cup and into a glass, the cup becomes empty.
He, sir, that must marry this woman.	Why, the he that will marry this woman.
Therefore, you clown, abandon—which is, in the vulgar, “leave”—the society—which in the boorish is “company”—of this female—which in the common is “woman”; which together is, abandon the society of this female, or, clown, thou perishest; or, to thy better understanding, diest; or, to wit, I kill thee, make thee away, translate thy life into death, thy liberty into bondage.	Or, rather, I’ll kill you, or I’ll do away with you, or I’ll turn your life into death and your freedom into captivity.
I will deal in poison with thee, or in bastinado, or in steel.	I’ll poison you, or beat you with a club, or stab you with a sword.
I will bandy with thee in faction.	I’ll bandy you about and overwhelm you with my cleverness.
I will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways.	I will, in other words, kill you in three hundred and fifty ways.
Therefore tremble and depart.	Therefore, tremble with fear and leave.
Do, good William.	Do what he says, William.
God rest you merry, sir.	Farewell, sir.
Our master and mistress seeks you.	Our master and mistress are looking for you.
Come away, away.	Let’s go.
Trip, Audrey, trip, Audrey.—I attend, I attend.	Hurry up, Audrey, hurry.—I’m coming, I’m coming.
Mistress, you must come away to your father.	Mistress, you have to go see your father.
Were you made the messenger?	Did they make you the messenger?
Of a certain knight that swore by his honor they were good pancakes, and swore by his honor the mustard was naught.	From a certain knight who swore on his honor that the pancakes he was eating were good, and that the mustard on top of them—he swore on his honor—was bad.
Now, I’ll stand to it, the pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and yet was not the knight forsworn.	Now, I’ll swear to the opposite—that the pancakes were rotten, and the mustard was fine—but even so, the knight wasn’t lying.
How prove you that in the great heap of your knowledge?	And how, out of your great heap of knowledge, will you manage to prove that?
Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.	Yes, please; unleash your wisdom.
Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins and swear by your beards that I am a knave.	Watch me: stroke your chins and swear by your beards that I am a knave.
By our beards (if we had them), thou art.	By our beards (if we had them), you are a knave.
By my knavery (if I had it), then I were.	And I swear by my wickedness (if I had any) that I am a knave.
Is ’t possible that on so little acquaintance you should like her?	Is it really possible that you could like her right after meeting her?
It shall be to your good, for my father’s house and all the revenue that was old Sir Rowland’s will I estate upon you, and here live and die a shepherd.	It will be to your advantage, because I’ll leave our father’s house and all his property to you, while I live and die a shepherd here in the forest.
You have my consent.	You have my consent.
Let your wedding be tomorrow.	You can be married tomorrow if you want.
Thither will I invite the duke and all’s contented followers.	I’ll invite the duke and all of his followers.
Go you and prepare Aliena, for look you, here comes my Rosalind.	Go get Aliena ready—because, look, here comes my Rosalind.
And you, fair sister.	And hello to you, fair sister.
O my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee wear thy heart in a scarf.	Oh, darling Orlando, it’s so hard to see you wearing your heart in a sling.
It is my arm.	Actually, it’s my arm.
I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a lion.	I thought your heart had been wounded by a lion’s claws.
They are in the very wrath of love, and they will together.	They’re in the heat of passion; they simply have to be together.
Clubs cannot part them.	You couldn’t beat the two of them apart.
They shall be married tomorrow, and I will bid the duke to the nuptial.	They’ll be married tomorrow, and I’ll invite the duke to the ceremony.
But Oh, how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man’s eyes.	But, oh, it makes me bitter to look at happiness through another man’s eyes.
By so much the more shall I tomorrow be at the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.	Tomorrow I’ll be at the depths of my misery thinking about the happiness my brother has achieved, in having what he wished for.
Why, then, tomorrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind?	Well then, can’t I act as Rosalind for you tomorrow?
I can live no longer by thinking.	I can’t live by pretending anymore.
I will weary you then no longer with idle talking.	I won’t exhaust you anymore with idle chitchat.
I speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you are.	You should know that I think you’re a smart man.
Believe then, if you please, that I can do strange things.	Believe me, then, that I have special powers.
I have, since I was three year old, conversed with a magician, most profound in his art and yet not damnable.	Since I was three years old, I’ve been in contact with a powerful but virtuous magician—no black magic here.
If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out, when your brother marries Aliena shall you marry her.	If you love Rosalind as much as you say you do, you will marry her when your brother marries Aliena.
I know into what straits of fortune she is driven, and it is not impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient to you, to set her before your eyes tomorrow, human as she is, and without any danger.	I know where she is and, if you don’t mind, I will set her before you tomorrow, whole and unharmed.
Speak’st thou in sober meanings?	Are you serious?
By my life I do, which I tender dearly, though I say I am a magician.	I swear on my life, which I take pretty seriously, even if I am a magician.
Look, here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers.	Look, here comes someone who loves me, along with someone who loves her.
I care not if I have.	I don’t care.
You are there followed by a faithful shepherd.	A faithful shepherd worships you.
Good shepherd, tell this youth what ’tis to love.	Silvius, tell this youth what it means to be in love.
It is to be all made of sighs and tears, And so am I for Phoebe.	It means being full of sighs and tears, like I am for Phoebe.
And I for Ganymede.	And like I am for Ganymede.
And I for Rosalind.	And like I am for Rosalind.
And I for no woman.	And like I am for no woman.
It is to be all made of faith and service, And so am I for Phoebe.	It means being faithful and ready to serve, just like I am for Phoebe.
And I for Ganymede.	And like I am for Ganymede.
And I for Rosalind.	And like I am for Rosalind.
And I for no woman.	And like I am for no woman.
It is to be all made of fantasy, All made of passion and all made of wishes, All adoration, duty, and observance, All humbleness, all patience and impatience, All purity, all trial, all observance, And so am I for Phoebe.	It means being filled with fantasy; with passion and wishes; with adoration, loyalty, and devotion.
And so am I for Rosalind.	And I for Rosalind.
And so am I for no woman.	And I for no woman.
If this be so, why blame you me to love you?	Since you know all this is true, why do you blame me for loving you?
If this be so, why blame you me to love you?	And why do you blame me for loving you?
If this be so, why blame you me to love you?	And why do you blame me for loving you?
Why do you speak, too, “Why blame you me to love you?”?	Who are you talking to?
To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.	I’m saying it to the girl who isn’t here and doesn’t hear me.
Pray you, no more of this.	All right, stop this.
Tis like the howling of Irish wolves against the moon.	You sound like a pack of wolves howling at the moon.
I’ll not fail, if I live.	As long as I’m alive, I’ll be here.
Nor I.	Me too.
Nor I.	Me too.
Tomorrow is the joyful day, Audrey.	Tomorrow is the happy day, Audrey.
Tomorrow will we be married.	We’ll be married tomorrow.
I do desire it with all my heart, and I hope it is no dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the world.	I hope it doesn’t make me unchaste that I really want to be a married woman.
Here comes two of the banished duke’s pages.	Here come two of Duke Senior’s pages.
Well met, honest gentleman.	Good afternoon, good gentleman.
By my troth, well met.	It really is good to see you.
Come, sit, sit, and a song.	Come, sit, sit, and sing me a song.
We are for you.	Sounds good to us.
Sit i' th' middle.	Sit between us.
Shall we clap into ’t roundly, without hawking or spitting or saying we are hoarse, which are the only prologues to a bad voice?	Should we just get down to it?
I' faith, i' faith, and both in a tune like two gypsies on a horse.	Yes, yes, and let’s sing in unison, like two gypsies riding on a single horse.
Truly, young gentlemen, though there was no great matter in the ditty, yet the note was very untunable.	Really, young men, though it wasn’t a very hard song to get right, the music was still all out of tune.
Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy Can do all this that he hath promisèd?	Orlando, do you really believe that this boy can do everything he’s promised?
That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.	Yes, even if I had whole kingdoms to give along with her.
That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.	I will, even if I were king of all kingdoms.
That will I, should I die the hour after.	Yes, even if I die an hour later.
But if you do refuse to marry me, You’ll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?	But if you decide not to marry me, you’ll marry this faithful shepherd instead?
So is the bargain.	That’s the deal.
Though to have her and death were both one thing.	Even if marrying her meant I died.
I have promised to make all this matter even.	I’ve promised to make everything right.
Keep your word, Phoebe, that you’ll marry me Or else, refusing me, to wed this shepherd.	Phoebe, keep your promise to marry me, and to marry this shepherd if you choose to refuse me.
Keep your word, Silvius, that you’ll marry her If she refuse me.	Silvius, keep your promise to marry Phoebe if she refuses me.
And from hence I go To make these doubts all even.	I’ll leave now, to set all these things right.
I do remember in this shepherd boy Some lively touches of my daughter’s favor.	This shepherd boy reminds me quite vividly of my daughter.
My lord, the first time that I ever saw him Methought he was a brother to your daughter.	My lord, when I first saw him I thought he was your daughter’s brother.
But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born And hath been tutored in the rudiments Of many desperate studies by his uncle, Whom he reports to be a great magician Obscurèd in the circle of this forest.	But, my lord, this boy was born in the forest and has been schooled not in the usual subjects but only in magic.
Good my lord, bid him welcome.	My lord, welcome this man.
This is the motley-minded gentleman that I have so often met in the forest.	This is the jester I have met so many times in the forest.
He hath been a courtier, he swears.	He swears he used to be a courtier.
If any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation.	If anyone doubts this, let him put me on trial.
I have undone three tailors.	I have bankrupted three tailors.
I have had four quarrels, and like to have fought one.	I have quarreled four times, and almost got in a fight.
And how was that ta'en up?	And how was that one settled?
Faith, we met and found the quarrel was upon the seventh cause.	Well, we almost fought and then realized that we had reached the seventh cause.
How “seventh cause”?—Good my lord, like this fellow.	What do you mean, the seventh cause?
I like him very well.	I like him very well.
Prithee, who is ’t that thou mean’st?	Tell me, who is this knight?
One that old Frederick, your father, loves.	A man old Frederick, your father, loves.
My father’s love is enough to honor him.	If he has my father’s love, then that’s enough honor for me.
Enough.	Enough of this.
Speak no more of him; you’ll be whipped for taxation one of these days.	No more talk about my father; you’ll be whipped for slander one of these days.
The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly.	It’s a pity that fools aren’t allowed to speak wisely about the foolish things that wise men do.
With his mouth full of news.	Honestly, you’re speaking the truth—ever since the fools were  With his mouth full of news.
Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young.	Which he’ll shove down our throats the way pigeons feed their young.
Then shall we be news-crammed.	Then we’ll be stuffed with news.
All the better.	Well that’s good.
We shall be the more marketable.—Bonjour, Monsieur Le Beau.	If we’re  Hello, Monsieur Le Beau.
What’s the news?	What’s the news?

A poor virgin, sir, an ill-favored thing, sir, but mine own.	This poor virgin isn’t much to look at, sir, but she’s mine.
By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.	Really, he’s very witty, and full of wise sayings.
But for the seventh cause.	But back to that argument you mentioned.
How did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause?	What’s the “seventh cause”?
Upon a lie seven times removed.—Bear your body more seeming, Audrey.—As thus, sir: I did dislike the cut of a certain courtier’s beard.	I didn’t like the way a particular courtier had cut his beard.
He sent me word if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the mind it was.	He sent me word that, whether I liked it or not, he liked it fine.
This is called “the countercheck quarrelsome,” and so to “the lie circumstantial” and “the lie direct.”  And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?	They call this “the argumentative countercheck.” And so on through “the circumstantial lie” and “the direct lie.” And how many times did you say his beard wasn’t cut well?
He’s as good at anything and yet a fool.	He’s as smart as they come, but just a jester.
He uses his folly like a stalking-horse, and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit.	He uses his clownishness to disguise his deadly wit.
Then is there mirth in heaven When earthly things, made even, Atone together.	There is laughter in heaven When earthly affairs are put right And people unite.
Good duke, receive thy daughter.	Good duke, come receive your daughter.
Hymen from heaven brought her, Yea, brought her hither, That thou mightst join her hand with his Whose heart within his bosom is.	Hymen brought her from heaven Yes, brought her here.
If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.	If my eyes don’t deceive me, you are my daughter.
If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.	If my eyes don’t deceive me, you are my Rosalind.
If sight and shape be true, Why then, my love adieu.	If my eyes aren’t deceiving me, goodbye, love.
Peace, ho!	Quiet!
O my dear niece, welcome thou art to me, Even daughter, welcome in no less degree.	My niece, you are welcome here as if you were my own daughter.
Let me have audience for a word or two.	Let me have your attention for a moment.
I am the second son of old Sir Rowland, That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.	I’m Sir Rowland’s middle son, and I bring you news.
Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day Men of great worth resorted to this forest, Addressed a mighty power, which were on foot In his own conduct, purposely to take His brother here and put him to the sword.	When Duke Frederick heard that great, worthy men were coming to this forest every day, he raised a large army to invade this land and fight his brother.
This to be true I do engage my life.	I swear on my life that I’m speaking the truth.
Sir, by your patience: if I heard you rightly, The duke hath put on a religious life And thrown into neglect the pompous court.	Do you mean to say that the duke has abandoned the glamorous court to live as a monk?
He hath.	Yes, he has.
To him will I.	I will go find him.
Out of these convertites There is much matter to be heard and learned.	There is much to be learned from these converts.
Stay, Jaques, stay.	Stay, Jaques, stay here for a bit.

Proceed, proceed.	Let’s proceed.
We’ll so begin these rites As we do trust they’ll end, in true delights.	We’ll begin the ceremony the way we hope it will end—with delight.
If it be true that good wine needs no bush, ’tis true that a good play needs no epilogue.	If it’s true that you don’t need

How shall I answer you?	I don’t understand—how should I answer that?
As wit and fortune will.	However your wit and luck allow.
You tell us the manner of the wrestling.	Tell us about this wrestling.
Well, the beginning that is dead and buried.	Well, we’ve missed the beginning; it’s dead and buried.
There comes an old man and his three sons— I could match this beginning with an old tale.	There comes an old man with his three sons— It sounds like the beginning of an old folktale.
Three proper young men of excellent growth and presence.	Three proper young men, all good looking and with great presence—
With bills on their necks: “Be it known unto all men by these presents.”  The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the duke’s wrestler, which Charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs, that there is little hope of life in him.	Right, and they wore proclamations around their necks, saying, “Be it known to all men by these  The eldest of the three brothers wrestled with Charles, the duke’s wrestler.
So he served the second, and so the third.	Charles did the same to the second brother, and the third.
Yonder they lie, the poor old man their father making such pitiful dole over them that all the beholders take his part with weeping.	They’re lying over there, and the poor old man, their father, weeps so piteously over them that the whole audience has joined him in grieving.
Alas!	Oh, dear!
But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies have lost?	But tell me, monsieur—what sport are the ladies missing?
Why, this that I speak of.	Why, the one I just told you about.
Or I, I promise thee.	Me too, I swear.
But is there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides?	Doesn’t anyone else want to see this, and hear breath wheezing out from broken ribs?
Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?	Shall we go watch this wrestling, cousin?
Yonder sure they are coming.	Yes, I see them coming.
Let us now stay and see it.	Let’s stay and watch.
Come on.	Come on.
Since the youth will not be entreated, his own peril on his forwardness.	Since the youth won’t be reasoned with, he’ll have to suffer for his stubbornness.
Is yonder the man?	Is that the man?
Even he, madam.	That’s him, madam.
Alas, he is too young.	Alas, he is too young.
Yet he looks successfully.	Yet he seems capable.
How now, daughter and cousin?	What’s up, daughter and niece?
Are you crept hither to see the wrestling?	Have you snuck over here to watch the wrestling?
Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave.	Yes, my lord, if you give us permission.
You will take little delight in it, I can tell you, there is such odds in the man.	You won’t enjoy it much, I can tell you, the odds are so against this young man.
In pity of the challenger’s youth, I would fain dissuade him, but he will not be entreated.	Because he’s so young, I’ve tried to discourage him, but he won’t listen.
Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.	Call him over here, good Monsieur Le Beau.
Yonder comes my master, your brother.	I remember, Adam, that’s  Here comes my master, your brother.
Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will shake me up.	Go hide, Adam, and you’ll hear how he abuses me.

I attend them with all respect and duty.	I’ll wait on them with all respect and duty.
Young man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?	Young man, have you challenged Charles the Wrestler?
No, fair princess.	No, lovely princess.
He is the general challenger.	He is the general challenger.
I come but in as others do, to try with him the strength of my youth.	I have only come in—like the others have—to try to fight him with the strength of my youth.
Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your years.	Young gentleman, you are too bold for your age.
You have seen cruel proof of this man’s strength.	You have seen the cruel proof of this man’s strength.
If you saw yourself with your eyes or knew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal enterprise.	If you took a good look at yourself, or if you thought about this more carefully, your fear would teach you to act more cautiously.
We pray you for your own sake to embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.	We beg you, for your own sake, to respect your safety and give up.
Do, young sir.	Please, young sir.
But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial, wherein, if I be foiled, there is but one shamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one dead that was willing to be so.	If I’m killed, it will only be the death of a man who was willing to be dead.
I shall do my friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me; the world no injury, for in it I have nothing.	I won’t wrong any of my friends, because I don’t have any to mourn for me, and I won’t have wronged the world, because I don’t have anything in the world.
Only in the world I fill up a place which may be better supplied when I have made it empty.	In this world, I’m only taking up space.
The little strength that I have, I would it were with you.	I wish I could give you the little strength that I have.
And mine, to eke out hers.	Mine too, to join hers.
Fare you well.	Good luck.
Pray heaven I be deceived in you.	I hope to God I’m wrong about your chances.
Your heart’s desires be with you.	I hope you get what you desire!
You shall try but one fall.	You get only one round.
No, I warrant your Grace you shall not entreat him to a second, that have so mightily persuaded him from a first.	No, I’m sure your Grace won’t be able to persuade him to try a second round, even though you couldn’t dissuade him from trying the first.
I would I were invisible, to catch the strong fellow by the leg.	You should mock me    I wish I were invisible, so I could grab that strong fellow by the leg.
O excellent young man!	Oh, what an excellent young man!
If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who should down.	If I could shoot lightning bolts from my eyes, I can tell you who’d be on the ground.
No more, no more.	No more, no more.
How dost thou, Charles?	How are you doing, Charles?
He cannot speak, my lord.	He can’t speak, my lord.
Bear him away.	Carry him away.
What is thy name, young man?	What is your name, young man?
Orlando, my liege, the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.	Orlando, my lord, the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.
I would thou hadst been son to some man else.	I wish you were someone else’s son.
The world esteemed thy father honorable, But I did find him still mine enemy.	The whole world thought your father was an honorable man, but he was always my enemy.
I would thou hadst told me of another father.	I wish you had told me you had a different father.
Were I my father, coz, would I do this?	If I were my father, cousin, would I do this?
I am more proud to be Sir Rowland’s son, His youngest son, and would not change that calling To be adopted heir to Frederick.	I’m proud to be Sir Rowland’s son—his youngest son—and I would never change that, not even to be Frederick’s adopted heir.
My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul, And all the world was of my father’s mind.	My father loved Sir Rowland as much as he loved his own soul, and the rest of the world shared my father’s opinion.
Had I before known this young man his son, I should have given him tears unto entreaties Ere he should thus have ventured.	If I had known this young man was his son, I would have tried harder to convince him not to fight.
Gentle cousin, Let us go thank him and encourage him.	Gentle cousin, let’s go thank him and encourage him.
Shall we go, coz?	Yes.
Ay.—Fare you well, fair gentleman.	Good luck, fair gentleman.
He calls us back.	He’s calling us back.
Will you go, coz?	My  Will you come on, cousin?
Have with you.	I’m coming.
Fare you well.	Farewell.
What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?	What is this passion that ties up my tongue?
I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference.	I can’t speak to her, even though she asked me to.
Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.	Either Charles or some prettier thing has mastered you.
Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you To leave this place.	Good sir, as a friend, I advise you to leave this place.
Albeit you have deserved High commendation, true applause, and love, Yet such is now the duke’s condition That he misconsters all that you have done.	Although you deserve praise, applause, and love, right now the duke misconstrues everything you’ve done.
The duke is humorous.	The duke is temperamental.
But I can tell you that of late this duke Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece, Grounded upon no other argument But that the people praise her for her virtues And pity her for her good father’s sake; And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady Will suddenly break forth.	But I will tell you that lately the duke has been displeased with his niece, and for no other reason than that people praise her virtues and pity her for her father’s sake.
Sir, fare you well.	Goodbye, sir.
Hereafter, in a better world than this, I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.	Later, in a better world than this, I’d love to get to know you.
I rest much bounden to you.	I’m indebted to you.
Fare you well.	Goodbye.
Thus must I from the smoke into the smother, From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother.	Out of the frying pan and into the fire—from a tyrant duke to a tyrant brother!
But heavenly Rosalind!	But, oh, heavenly Rosalind!
Why, Rosalind!	What’s going on, Rosalind?
Not one to throw at a dog.	I don’t even have one to throw at a dog.
No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs.	No, your words are too precious to be wasted on dogs.
Throw some of them at me.	Throw some of your words at me.
Then there were two cousins laid up, when the one should be lamed with reasons and the other mad without any.	Then there would be two cousins lying sick in bed: one hurt by reasons and the other gone crazy without any.
But is all this for your father?	Is all of this about your father?
No, some of it is for my child’s father.	No, some of it is about my child’s father.
If we walk not in the trodden paths our very petticoats will catch them.	If we walk on the well-worn paths, they won’t get caught in our petticoats.
Hem them away.	Cough them up.
I would try, if I could cry “hem” and have him.	I’d try it, if I could cry “hem” and have him.
Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.	Come on, take control of your feelings.
Oh, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself.	But they’re siding with a better wrestler than myself.
Oh, a good wish upon you.	Oh, that’s a good wish!
The duke my father loved his father dearly.	You’ll fight with him eventually, and  The duke, my father, loved his father very much.
Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly?	Does that necessarily mean you should love his son?
By this kind of chase I should hate him, for my father hated his father dearly.	By that kind of logic, I should hate Orlando, since my father hates his father.
Yet I hate not Orlando.	But I don’t hate Orlando.
No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.	No, please don’t hate him—for my sake.
Why should I not?	Why shouldn’t I?
Doth he not deserve well?	Doesn’t he deserve it?
Let me love him for that, and do you love him because I do.	Let me love him because he deserves it, and you can love him because I do.
Look, here comes the duke.	Look, here comes the duke.
With his eyes full of anger.	He looks angry.
Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste, And get you from our court.	Madam, hurry as fast as you can get out of my court.
Me, uncle?	Me, uncle?
You, cousin.	You, niece.
Within these ten days if that thou beest found So near our public court as twenty miles, Thou diest for it.	In ten days time, if you’re found within twenty miles of the court, you’ll die for it.
I do beseech your Grace, Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me.	Please, your Grace, tell me what crime I have committed.
If with myself I hold intelligence Or have acquaintance with mine own desires, If that I do not dream or be not frantic— As I do trust I am not—then, dear uncle, Never so much as in a thought unborn Did I offend your Highness.	If I know my own thoughts and desires, and I’m not dreaming or crazy—which I’m sure I’m not—then, dear uncle, I’ve never had so much as a half-formed thought that would have offended you.
Thus do all traitors.	All traitors protest like this.
If their purgation did consist in words, They are as innocent as grace itself.	If they could purge their guilt simply by saying that they were innocent, they’d all be as innocent as God Himself.
Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.	I don’t trust you.
Thou art thy father’s daughter.	You are your father’s daughter.
There’s enough.	That’s enough.
So was I when your Highness took his dukedom.	I was his daughter when your Highness took my father’s dukedom.
So was I when your Highness banished him.	I was his daughter when you banished him.
My father was no traitor.	My father wasn’t a traitor.
Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much To think my poverty is treacherous.	So, please, my lord, don’t assume that I’m treacherous just because I’m poor, with no titles to my name.
Dear sovereign, hear me speak.	Dear master, listen to me.
Ay, Celia, we stayed her for your sake.	Yes, Celia, we kept her here for your sake.
I was too young that time to value her, But now I know her.	I was too young at the time to appreciate her value, but now I know her.
If she be a traitor, Why so am I.	If she’s a traitor, why then, so am I.
Thou art a fool.	You’re a fool.
She robs thee of thy name, And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous When she is gone.	You will seem even brighter and more virtuous when she’s out of the picture.
Then open not thy lips.	So be quiet.
Firm and irrevocable is my doom Which I have passed upon her.	The sentence I’ve passed down on her is firm and unshakeable.
She is banished.	She is banished.
Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege.	Then lay that sentence on me too, my lord.
I cannot live out of her company.	I cannot live without her.
You are a fool.—You, niece, provide yourself.	You are a fool.—You, niece, prepare to leave.
If you outstay the time, upon mine honor And in the greatness of my word, you die.	On my honor and by my word, if you outstay the ten days, you will die.
O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go?	Oh, my poor Rosalind, where will you go?
Wilt thou change fathers?	Do you want to exchange fathers?
I will give thee mine.	I’ll give you mine.
I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am.	I insist, don’t be more distressed than I am.
I have more cause.	I have more reason to be distressed.
Now, sir, what make you here?	Hey, you!
Nothing.	What are you  Nothing.
I am not taught to make anything.	I’ve never been taught how to make anything.
What mar you then, sir?	Well, then, what are you messing up?
Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.	I’m helping  Indeed, sir, find something better to do and get lost for a while.
Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?	Should I tend your pigs and eat husks with them?
Know you where you are, sir?	When did I  Do you know where you are, sir?
O sir, very well: here in your orchard.	Yes, sir, very well—I’m here in your orchard.
Know you before whom, sir?	Do you know whom you’re talking to?
Ay, better than him I am before knows me.	Yes, better than you know me.
I know you are my eldest brother, and in the gentle condition of blood you should so know me.	I know you’re my oldest brother, and deserve more respect.
I have as much of my father in me as you, albeit, I confess, your coming before me is nearer to his reverence.	I have as much of our father in me as you do, though I admit you’re closer to him and matter more because you’re older.
Thou hast not, cousin.	No you haven’t, cousin.
Prithee, be cheerful.	Please, be cheerful.
Know’st thou not the duke Hath banished me, his daughter?	Don’t you realize the duke has also banished me, his daughter?
That he hath not.	No, he hasn’t.
No, hath not?	Oh, he hasn’t?
Rosalind lacks then the love Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one.	Well, then, you don’t have the affection that would teach you that you and I are one.
Shall we be sundered?	Will we be separated?
Shall we part, sweet girl?	Should we part, sweet girl?
For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale, Say what thou canst, I’ll go along with thee.	I swear by the heavens, which have grown pale in sympathy with us, I’m going with you, whatever you say.
Why, whither shall we go?	But where will we go?
To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden.	To the Forest of Arden, to find your father.
Alas, what danger will it be to us, Maids as we are, to travel forth so far?	But what danger we’ll put ourselves in, two young, innocent women traveling so far!
Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.	Fresh beauty attracts thugs and thieves even more than money.
I’ll put myself in poor and mean attire And with a kind of umber smirch my face.	I’ll put on some poor and ragged clothes and smudge my face with dirt.
Were it not better, Because that I am more than common tall, That I did suit me all points like a man?	Wouldn’t it be better—since I’m unusually tall for a woman—to dress myself like a man?
A gallant curtal-axe upon my thigh, A boar-spear in my hand, and in my heart Lie there what hidden woman’s fear there will, We’ll have a swashing and a martial outside— As many other mannish cowards have That do outface it with their semblances.	I’ll wear a big sword in my belt, carry a boar-spear in my hand, and hide all my womanish fear in my heart.
What shall I call thee when thou art a man?	What should I call you when you’re a man?
I’ll have no worse a name than Jove’s own page, And therefore look you call me Ganymede.	I’ll take no lesser name than that of  Something that refers to my current state.
But what will you be called?	Instead of Celia, call me Aliena.
Would he not be a comfort to our travel?	Wouldn’t he be a comfort to us in our travels?
Leave me alone to woo him.	Let’s go gather our jewels and money.
Let’s away And get our jewels and our wealth together, Devise the fittest time and safest way To hide us from pursuit that will be made After my flight.	We’ll figure out the best time and safest route to avoid being found out by my father’s guards, whom he’ll send out as soon as he discovers I’ve gone.
Now go we in content To liberty, and not to banishment.	Now, we go contentedly to freedom—not banishment.
Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile, Hath not old custom made this life more sweet Than that of painted pomp?	Now, my companions and brothers in exile, hasn’t experience made this simple life sweeter than a life of glittery pomp and circumstance?
Are not these woods More free from peril than the envious court?	Aren’t these woods less perilous than the court, with all its jealousies and intrigues?
These are counselors That feelingly persuade me what I am.” Sweet are the uses of adversity, Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous, Wears yet a precious jewel in his head.	I smile and think, “Thank goodness the wind doesn’t flatter me: it’s like a councilor who makes me feel what I’m really made of.” Adversity can have its benefits—like the ugly, poisonous  I wouldn’t change my situation for anything.
And this our life, exempt from public haunt, Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, Sermons in stones, and good in everything.	You’re lucky, my lord, to be able to see the peace and sweetness even in what bad luck has brought you.
I would not change it.	Come, shall we hunt some deer for dinner?
Happy is your Grace, That can translate the stubbornness of fortune Into so quiet and so sweet a style.	It bothers me, though, that these poor spotted innocents, who, after all, are this deserted city’s native citizens, should be gouged with arrows.
Come, shall we go and kill us venison?	Indeed, my lord, the gloomy Jaques grieves over these deaths.
And indeed, my lord, The wretched animal heaved forth such groans That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat Almost to bursting, and the big round tears Coursed one another down his innocent nose In piteous chase.	Big, round tears ran piteously down the animal’s innocent nose.
And did you leave him in this contemplation?	And did you leave him like this?
We did, my lord, weeping and commenting Upon the sobbing deer.	We did, my lord, weeping and carrying on about the sobbing deer.
Show me the place.	Take me to him.
I love to cope him in these sullen fits, For then he’s full of matter.	I love to argue with him when he’s having one of these fits, because then he always has a lot to say.
I’ll bring you to him straight.	I’ll bring you to him right away.
Can it be possible that no man saw them?	Can it be possible that no one saw them leave?
It cannot be.	It cannot be.
Some villains of my court Are of consent and sufferance in this.	Some villains in my court must have known about this and let it happen.
I cannot hear of any that did see her.	I can’t find anyone who saw her leave.
The ladies, her attendants of her chamber Saw her abed, and in the morning early They found the bed untreasured of their mistress.	Her ladies-in-waiting saw her go to bed, and early this morning the bed was empty.
My lord, the roinish clown, at whom so oft Your Grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.	My lord, that dirty clown whom you laughed at so often is also missing.
Send to his brother.	Send a message to his brother.
Fetch that gallant hither.	Bring that swinger Orlando here.
If he be absent, bring his brother to me.	If he’s not around, bring his brother Oliver to me.
I’ll make him find him.	I’ll make Oliver find him.
Do this suddenly, And let not search and inquisition quail To bring again these foolish runaways.	Do this immediately, and don’t stop searching and interrogating until you’ve brought home these foolish runaways.
Who’s there?	Who’s there?
Why, what make you here?	What are you doing here?
Why are you virtuous?	Why are you so strong and good?
Why do people love you?	Why do people love you?
And wherefore are you gentle, strong, and valiant?	And why are you noble, strong, and brave?
Why would you be so fond to overcome The bonny prizer of the humorous duke?	Why would you be so foolish as to beat the moody duke’s favorite champion?
Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.	Your praise has beaten you home.
Know you not, master, to some kind of men Their graces serve them but as enemies?	Don’t you know, master, that some men’s best qualities do them in?
Oh, what a world is this when what is comely Envenoms him that bears it!	Oh, what a world this is, when even what is beautiful in a man poisons him!
Why, what’s the matter?	Why, what’s the matter?
Within this roof The enemy of all your graces lives.	In this house lives a man who despises all that is good in you.
Your brother—no, no brother—yet the son— Yet not the son, I will not call him son— Of him I was about to call his father Hath heard your praises, and this night he means To burn the lodging where you use to lie, And you within it.	Oliver, your brother—no, not your brother; and yet he’s the son—but no, I won’t call him the son—of that great man I was about to call his father, has heard about how well you did in the wrestling match, and tonight he’s planning on burning your house down, with you in it.
If he fail of that, He will have other means to cut you off.	And if he fails at that, he will find other ways to kill you.
I overheard him and his practices.	I overheard him and his plans.
This is no place, this house is but a butchery.	This is no place for you; this home is now a slaughterhouse.
Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.	Hate it, fear it, do not come inside.
Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?	Then where would you have me go, Adam?
No matter whither, so you come not here.	It doesn’t matter where, so long as it’s not here.
What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food, Or with a base and boist'rous sword enforce A thievish living on the common road?	What, would you have me beg for my food?
Yet this I will not do, do how I can.	This is all that’s left for me to do, but I won’t do it.
I rather will subject me to the malice Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.	I’d rather give myself up to the hatred of a violent brother who refuses to recognize that we are brothers.
But do not so.	But don’t do that.
Let me be your servant.	Let me be your servant.
Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty, For in my youth I never did apply Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo The means of weakness and debility.	I know I may be old, but I’m strong and healthy, because in my youth I never drank nor lived recklessly.
Therefore my age is as a lusty winter, Frosty but kindly.	Therefore, my old age is like a blustery winter: cold, but kindly.
Let me go with you.	Let me go with you.
I’ll do the service of a younger man In all your business and necessities.	I’ll do everything a younger man could do for you.
O good old man, how well in thee appears The constant service of the antique world, When service sweat for duty, not for meed.	Oh, good old man, you’re a great example of that old work ethic, where people worked because it was their duty, not just for the money.
But come thy ways.	Come along, though.
We’ll go along together, And ere we have thy youthful wages spent, We’ll light upon some settled low content.	We’ll go together, and before we’ve spent all the savings of your youth, we’ll find a way to make a living.
Master, go on, and I will follow thee To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.	Go on, master, and I will follow you—with truth and loyalty to my last breath.
From seventeen years till now almost fourscore Here livèd I, but now live here no more.	From the time I was seventeen, over sixty years ago, I have lived in this house, but now I will live here no more.
At seventeen years, many their fortunes seek, But at fourscore, it is too late a week.	Many men seek their fortune at seventeen; at eighty, it’s a bit late.
Yet fortune cannot recompense me better Than to die well, and not my master’s debtor.	But fortune could not reward me better than to let me die well, without owing my master anything.
O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!	Oh Lord, my spirits are tired!
I care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary.	I wouldn’t care about my spirits, if my legs weren’t tired.
I cannot go no further.	I can’t go any further.
For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear you.	I’d rather bear with you than  Well, this is the Forest of Arden.
Ay, now am I in Arden, the more fool I.	Yes, now I’m in Arden, and that makes me the bigger fool.
Ay, be so, good Touchstone.	Yes, be content, good Touchstone.
Look you who comes here, a young man and an old in solemn talk.	Look who’s coming: a young man and an old man, having a serious talk.
Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?	What, you dare put your hands on me, villain?
I am no villain.	I’m no villain.
Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy tongue for saying so.	If you weren’t my brother, I’d leave this hand of mine on your neck until I’d pulled out your tongue for talking like this.
Thou hast railed on thyself.	You’ve only insulted yourself.
Sweet masters, be patient.	Gentlemen, calm down.
For your father’s remembrance, be at accord.	For the sake of your father’s memory, make peace.
Let me go, I say.	Let me go, I say.
I will not till I please.	I won’t until I’m ready.
You shall hear me.	You will listen to me.
My father charged you in his will to give me good education.	My father instructed you in his will to give me a good education.
You have trained me like a peasant, obscuring and hiding from me all gentlemanlike qualities.	But you’ve raised me as a peasant, hiding from me what I needed to become a gentleman.
The spirit of my father grows strong in me, and I will no longer endure it.	My father’s spirit is growing in me, and I won’t take this any longer.
And what wilt thou do—beg when that is spent?	And what are you going to do after you’ve spent your money?
Well, sir, get you in.	Well, sir, go inside.
I will not long be troubled with you.	I’m not going to be bothered by you for long.
You shall have some part of your will.	You’ll get some of what you want.
I pray you leave me.	Now please leave me alone.
That is the way to make her scorn you still.	What you’re doing is the way to make her scorn you continually.
O Corin, that thou knew’st how I do love her!	Oh, Corin, I wish you could understand how much I love her!
I partly guess, for I have loved ere now.	I’m sure I can guess.
No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess, Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover As ever sighed upon a midnight pillow.	No Corin, since you’re old, you cannot guess—even if you were as dedicated a lover in your youth as there ever was, sighing and mooning all night long.
But if thy love were ever like to mine— As sure I think did never man love so— How many actions most ridiculous Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?	If your love was anything like mine—and I’m sure that no man has loved as I love now—exactly how many ridiculous actions did your fantasizing lead you to?
Into a thousand that I have forgotten.	Oh, a thousand of them, all of which I’ve forgotten.
Oh, thou didst then ne'er love so heartily.	Oh, then you never loved as wholeheartedly as me.
If thou rememb’rest not the slightest folly That ever love did make thee run into, Thou hast not loved.	If you can’t remember the stupidest little thing love made you do, you haven’t loved.
Or if thou hast not sat as I do now, Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress’s praise, Thou hast not loved.	Or if you haven’t sat as I do now, boring your listener with all your lover’s virtues, then you haven’t loved.
Or if thou hast not broke from company Abruptly, as my passion now makes me, Thou hast not loved.	Or if you haven’t broken away from human company, as my feelings now lead me to do, you haven’t loved.
O Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe!	O Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe!
Alas, poor shepherd, searching of thy wound, I have by hard adventure found mine own.	Oh, poor shepherd!
And I mine.	Me too.
I remember when I was in love I broke my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for coming a- night to Jane Smile.	I remember when I was in love, I broke my sword on a stone, and told him to take that for coming at night to see Jane Smile.
And I remember the kissing of her batler, and the cow’s dugs that her pretty chopped hands had milked.	I remember kissing her washing stick and the cow’s udders that her pretty, chapped hands had milked.
And I remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I took two cods and, giving her them again, said with weeping tears, “Wear these for my sake.” We that are true lovers run into strange capers.	I remember wooing a pea plant in her name, and then taking two pea pods and begging her to wear them “for my sake.” Those of us who are really in love will do the strangest things.
But as all is mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal in folly.	But everything that lives is mortal, including the foolishness of love.
Thou speak’st wiser than thou art ware of.	You speak more wisely than you know.
Nay, I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I break my shins against it.	Nah, I’ll never be aware of my own wit, until I break my shins on it.
Jove, Jove, this shepherd’s passion Is much upon my fashion.	By God!
And mine, but it grows something stale with me.	And like mine, but I’m getting a little tired of it.
I pray you, one of you question yond man, if he for gold will give us any food.	Please, one of you go ask that man over there if we can buy some food off him.
Peace, fool.	Shut up, fool.
He’s not thy kinsman.	He’s not your relative.
Who calls?	Who’s calling?
Your betters, sir.	Your superiors.
I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold Can in this desert place buy entertainment, Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed.	Please sir, if love or money can buy anything in this empty place, tell us where we can rest and feed ourselves.
Fair sir, I pity her And wish, for her sake more than for mine own, My fortunes were more able to relieve her.	Dear sir, I pity the lady and wish—more for her sake than my own—that I was more able to help her.
But I am shepherd to another man And do not shear the fleeces that I graze.	But I’m a hired hand: I don’t profit from the flocks I tend.
Besides, his cote, his flocks, and bounds of feed Are now on sale, and at our sheepcote now, By reason of his absence, there is nothing That you will feed on.	Besides, his cottage, his flocks, and his grazing rights are on sale now, and since he’s not there, there’s nothing to eat at our house.
What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?	Who wants to buy the flock and the pasture?
That young swain that you saw here but erewhile, That little cares for buying anything.	That young man who was just here.
I pray thee, if it stand with honesty, Buy thou the cottage, pasture, and the flock, And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.	Please, if you can do it without taking advantage of the young man, buy the cottage, pasture, and flock for us, and we’ll pay you for it.
And we will mend thy wages.	And we will raise your wages.

More, more, I prithee, more.	More, more, please, more.
It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.	It’s only going to make you sad, Monsieur Jaques.
I thank it.	I’m glad about that.
More, I prithee, more.	More, please, more.
I can suck melancholy out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs.	I can suck sadness out of a song the way a weasel sucks eggs.
More, I prithee, more.	More, please, more.
My voice is ragged.	My voice is ragged.
I know I cannot please you.	I know I won’t please you.
Come, more, another stanzo.	Come on, another stanza—is that what you call 'em, “stanzas”?
Nay, I care not for their names.	Nah, I don’t care what their
Well then, if ever I thank any man, I’ll thank you.	Well then, if I’ve ever thanked a man, I’ll thank you now.
But that they call “compliment” is like th' encounter of two dog- apes.	But two men complimenting each other is like two baboons getting together.
Well, I’ll end the song.—Sirs, cover the while; the duke will drink under this tree.—He hath been all this day to look you.	The duke will drink under this tree.—He’s been looking for you all day, you know.
And I have been all this day to avoid him.	And I’ve been avoiding him all day.
He is too disputable for my company.	He’s too argumentative for me.
I think of as many matters as he, but I give heaven thanks and make no boast of them.	I think of as many things as he does, but I just thank heaven and don’t show off about it.
Come, warble, come.	Come, warble for me.
I’ll give you a verse to this note that I made yesterday in despite of my invention.	I wrote a verse to this tune, though it’s not very imaginative.
Dear master, I can go no further.	Dear master, I can’t go any farther.
Oh, I die for food.	Oh, I’m dying of hunger.
Here lie I down and measure out my grave.	I’ll lie down here and measure out my grave.
Farewell, kind master.	Farewell, kind master.
Why, how now, Adam?	Hey, what’s this, Adam?
No greater heart in thee?	No braver than this?
Live a little, comfort a little, cheer thyself a little.	Live a little, be comforted a little, cheer up a little.
If this uncouth forest yield anything savage, I will either be food for it or bring it for food to thee.	If I can find any animal in this wild forest, I’ll either be food for it or bring it as food for you.
Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers.	You’re not as close to death as you think you are.
I will here be with thee presently, and if I bring thee not something to eat, I will give thee leave to die.	I’ll be back soon, and if I haven’t brought you anything to eat, I will give you permission to die.
But if thou diest before I come, thou art a mocker of my labor.	But if you die before I return, you’ll have made a mockery of my efforts.
Well said.	There we go!
Thou look’st cheerly, and I’ll be with thee quickly.	You look happier already, and I’ll be back quickly.
Yet thou liest in the bleak air.	But you’re lying out in the cold.
Cheerly, good Adam.	Cheer up, good Adam.
I think he be transformed into a beast, For I can nowhere find him like a man.	I think he must have turned into an animal, because I can’t find him anywhere looking like a man.
My lord, he is but even now gone hence.	My lord, he just left here.
Here was he merry, hearing of a song.	He was happy here, listening to a song.
If he, compact of jars, grow musical, We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.	If that man, who’s made up of conflicts, becomes musical, then there must be something wrong with the universe.
Go seek him.	Go find him.
Tell him I would speak with him.	Tell him I want to speak with him.
He saves my labor by his own approach.	He saved me the trouble: here he comes.
Why, how now, monsieur?	Well, what’s going on, mister?
What a life is this That your poor friends must woo your company?	What kind of life do you lead that your poor friends must beg for your company?
What, you look merrily.	What, you look amused.
And then he drew a dial from his poke And, looking on it with lackluster eye, Says very wisely, “It is ten o'clock.	Then he pulled a watch from his bag and, looking at it solemnly, said, “It’s ten o'clock.
Thus we may see,” quoth he, “how the world wags.	This way, we can see how the world moves.
Tis but an hour ago since it was nine, And after one hour more ’twill be eleven.	Only an hour ago it was nine, and in another hour it will be eleven.
O noble fool!	Oh, noble fool!
A worthy fool!	A worthy fool!
Motley’s the only wear.	Motley is the only thing to wear.
What fool is this?	Who is this fool?
Oh, that I were a fool!	A worthy fool!
God be with my old master.	God bless my old master.
He would not have spoke such a word.	He would never have spoken to me like this.
Is it even so?	Is that how it’s going to be?
Begin you to grow upon me?	Are you starting to challenge me?
I will physic your rankness and yet give no thousand crowns neither.—Holla, Dennis!	I’ll cure you of your insolence, and I’m not going to give you a thousand crowns, either!—Hey, Dennis!
Calls your Worship?	Did you call for me, your Worship?
Was not Charles, the duke’s wrestler, here to speak with me?	Wasn’t Charles, the duke’s wrestler, here to speak with me?
So please you, he is here at the door and importunes access to you.	Yes, sir, he’s here at the door right now and asks to see you.
Call him in.	Call him in.
Twill be a good way, and tomorrow the wrestling is.	I have a good plan.
I must have liberty Withal, as large a charter as the wind, To blow on whom I please, for so fools have.	Like the wind, I must have the freedom to blast anyone I please, as fools do.
And they that are most gallèd with my folly, They most must laugh.	And whoever is most irritated by my foolishness has to laugh the hardest.
And why, sir, must they so?	Why, sir, must he?
The “why” is plain as way to parish church: He that a fool doth very wisely hit Doth very foolishly, although he smart, Not to seem senseless of the bob.	Well, it’s as plain as the beaten path to a parish church.
Invest me in my motley.	Dress me up in motley.
Give me leave To speak my mind, and I will through and through Cleanse the foul body of th' infected world, If they will patiently receive my medicine.	Let me speak my mind, and I’ll rid the world of its sickness—if it will only tolerate my medicine.
Fie on thee!	To hell with you!
I can tell what thou wouldst do.	I know what you’d do.
What, for a counter, would I do but good?	What would I do besides good?
Most mischievous foul sin in chiding sin, For thou thyself hast been a libertine, As sensual as the brutish sting itself, And all th' embossèd sores and headed evils That thou with license of free foot hast caught Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.	You would be committing a wicked sin by chiding other people for sinning, because you yourself have been a terrible sinner, as carnal in your appetites as lust itself, and all the swollen pustules of sin that you acquired in your freedom you now want to burst and shoot back into the world at large.
Who can come in and say that I mean her, When such a one as she such is her neighbor?	Who can say I mean just her when all her neighbors are exactly like her?

Of what kind should this cock come of?	What kind of fighting cock is this?
Art thou thus boldened, man, by thy distress Or else a rude despiser of good manners, That in civility thou seem’st so empty?	Are you acting so boldly from hardship or because you despise good manners?
You touched my vein at first.	You were right the first time.
But forbear, I say.	But stop, I say.
An you will not be answered with reason, I must die.	If you won’t listen to reason, I’ll have to die.
What would you have?	What would you like?
Your gentleness shall force More than your force move us to gentleness.	Gentlemanly manners have more sway around here than force does.
I almost die for food, and let me have it.	I’m dying for food, so let me have some.
Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.	Sit down and eat, and welcome to our table.
Speak you so gently?	Do you really speak like such a gentleman?
Pardon me, I pray you.	I beg your pardon.
I thought that all things had been savage here, And therefore put I on the countenance Of stern commandment.	I thought everything out here was wild, which is why I acted so stern and commanding.
True is it that we have seen better days And have with holy bell been knolled to church, And sat at good men’s feasts and wiped our eyes Of drops that sacred pity hath engendered.	We have in fact seen better days and been summoned to church by the ringing of the holy bell and sat at good men’s feasts and cried tears of pity—therefore, sit down and take whatever will satisfy your needs.

All the world’s a stage, And all the men and women merely players.	The whole world is a stage, and all the men and women merely actors.
They have their exits and their entrances, And one man in his time plays many parts, His acts being seven ages.	They have their exits and their entrances, and in his lifetime a man will play many parts, his life separated into seven acts.

And then the justice, In fair round belly with good capon lined, With eyes severe and beard of formal cut, Full of wise saws and modern instances; And so he plays his part.	He’s full of wise sayings and up-to-the-minute anecdotes: that’s the way he plays his part.
Welcome.	Welcome.
Set down your venerable burden, And let him feed.	Set the honorable old man down and let him eat.

Bear it straight, And bring thy master home immediately.	Take it to your master and bring him home immediately.
There’s not a man I meet but doth salute me As if I were their well-acquainted friend, And every one doth call me by my name.	Every person I meet greets me like an old friend, and every one of them knows my name.
Some tender money to me; some invite me; Some other give me thanks for kindnesses; Some offer me commodities to buy.	Some of them give me money, some invite me places, some thank me for the kind things I’ve done for them, some try to sell me things.
Even now a tailor called me in his shop And showed me silks that he had bought for me, And therewithal took measure of my body.	Just now a tailor showed me fabrics he bought especially for me and then started to take my measurements.
Sure, these are but imaginary wiles, And lapland sorcerers inhabit here.	These are tricks of the imagination, and this place is filled with magicians.
Master, here’s The gold you sent me for.	Here’s the money you wanted, master.
What Adam dost thou mean?	Who’s this Adam you speak of?
Not that Adam that kept the Paradise, but that Adam that keeps the prison; he that goes in the calf’s skin that was killed for the Prodigal; he that came behind you, sir, like an evil angel, and bid you forsake your liberty.	Not the Adam from the garden of Eden, but the Adam from the jailhouse.
I understand thee not.	I don’t know what you’re talking about.
No?	No?
What, thou meanest an officer?	You mean an officer?
Ay, sir, the sergeant of the band; he that brings any man to answer it that breaks his band; one that thinks a man always going to bed and says “God give you good rest.”  Well, sir, there rest in your foolery.	Yes, the leader of the team; the one that gets you if you can’t pay a debt; the one who assumes people are always going to bed and says to them, “Have arrest.” Well, sir, stop your joking there.
Is there any ships put forth tonight?	Are any ships leaving tonight?
May we be gone?	Can we go?
Why, sir, I brought you word an hour since that the bark  The fellow is distract, and so am I, And here we wander in illusions.	Why, sir, I told you an hour ago that the good ship  This fellow’s gone mad, and so have I. We’re in some kind of dream world.
Some blessed power deliver us from hence!	Please, somebody, get us out of here!
Well met, well met, Master Antipholus.	Good to see you, Master Antipholus.
I see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now.	I see you’ve met with the jeweler.
Is that the chain you promised me today?	Is that chain you’re wearing the one you promised to give to me?
Satan, avoid!	Get away from me, Satan!
I charge thee, tempt me not.	Don’t try to tempt me!
Master, is this Mistress Satan?	Master, is this Satan’s mistress?
It is the devil.	She’s the devil.
Nay, she is worse; she is the devil’s dam, and here she comes in the habit of a light wench.	No, she’s worse: she’s the devil’s mother, and she comes to us disguised as an easy wench.
Light is an effect of fire, and fire will burn: ergo, light wenches will burn.	But fire also gives off light, and fire will burn you.
Your man and you are marvelous merry, sir.	You and your servant are very funny, sir.
Will you go with me?	Will you come with me?
We’ll mend our dinner here.	Can we finish our lunch?
Master, if you do, expect spoon meat; or bespeak a long spoon.	Master, if you eat with her, bring really long silverware.
Why, Dromio?	Why, Dromio?
I pray you, sir, my ring or else the chain.	Some  Now listen, either give me my ring or give me the necklace.
I hope you do not mean to cheat me so.	I hope you’re not trying to cheat me.
Avaunt, thou witch!—Come, Dromio, let us go.	Come, Dromio, let’s go.
Mistress, that you know.	Mistress, you know about that.
Now, out of doubt Antipholus is mad; Else would he never so demean himself.	Antipholus has gone insane, no question about it.
A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats, And for the same he promised me a chain.	He has a ring of mine, worth forty ducats, and he promised to give me a necklace in exchange for it.
Both one and other he denies me now.	Now he won’t give me either.
The reason that I gather he is mad, Besides this present instance of his rage, Is a mad tale he told today at dinner Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.	The reason I think he’s insane, besides the way he just acted, is that he told a senseless story over lunch about being locked out of his own house.
Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits, On purpose shut the doors against his way.	His wife probably did it on purpose because she knows what kind of fits he’s having.
My way is now to hie home to his house And tell his wife that, being lunatic, He rushed into my house and took perforce My ring away.	I must go to his house and tell his wife that he came bursting into my place like a lunatic and stole my ring.
This course I fittest choose, For forty ducats is too much to lose.	It’s my best option: I can’t afford to lose forty ducats.
Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece, Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia, And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus, Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought Or that or any place that harbors men.	I’ve spent five years in the remotest parts of Greece and roaming all over Asia.
But though thou art adjudgèd to the death, And passèd sentence may not be recalled But to our honour’s great disparagement, Yet will I favor thee in what I can.	However, I’ll do what I can for you.
Therefore, merchant, I’ll limit thee this day To seek thy life by beneficial help.	I will allow you one day to look for help in Ephesus.
I will, my lord.	I will.
Fear me not, man.	Don’t worry, man, I won’t try to escape.
I tell you, ’twill sound harshly in her ears.	I tell you, this will make her angry when she hears about it.
Here comes my man.	Here’s my servant.
I think he brings the money.	I think he’s got the money.
How now, sir?	Hello there, sir!
Have you that I sent you for?	Do you have what I told you to get?
Here’s that, I warrant you, will pay them all.	Yes.
But where’s the money?	But where’s the money?
Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope.	Why, sir, I spent it on this rope.
I’ll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.	I can get you five hundred ropes for that price.
To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?	Why did I just send you home?
To a rope’s end, sir, and to that end am I returned.	And here I am, with that piece.
And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.	And I’ll use that piece of rope to welcome you with.
Good sir, be patient.	Good sir, calm down.
Good now, hold thy tongue.	Hold your tongue.
Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.	No, you should tell him to hold his hands!
I would I were senseless, sir, that I might not feel your blows.	I wish I were senseless, sir, so that I wouldn’t feel your punches!
Thou art sensible in nothing but blows, and so is an ass.	The only thing you can sense are punches—just like an ass.
I am an ass, indeed; you may prove it by my long ears.—I have served him from the hour of my nativity to this instant, and have nothing at his hands for my service but blows.	I am an ass, indeed: you can tell by my long ears.
Nay, I bear it on my shoulders as a beggar wont her brat, and I think when he hath lamed me, I shall beg with it from door to door.	I figure that once he’s crippled me, I’ll beg by showing off my beatings.
Come, go along.	That’s enough.
My wife is coming yonder.	My wife’s coming.
Mistress,  Wilt thou still talk?	Mistress, think about your end—beware of your death!
How say you now?	EPHESUS Now what do you think?
Is not your husband mad?	Your husband’s mad, isn’t he?
Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy.	He’s trembling in his fit!
I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven.	I demand this in the name of all the saints in heaven.
Peace, doting wizard, peace.	Shut up, you doddering old wizard!
I am not mad.	I’m not possessed!
O, that thou wert not, poor distressèd soul!	Oh, I wish you weren’t, you poor, frightened soul.
You minion, you, are these your customers?	Listen, hussy—is this man one of your customers?
Did this companion with the saffron face Revel and feast it at my house today Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut And I denied to enter in my house?	Did this fool with the yellow face feast and celebrate in my house today while the guilty doors shut in my face and locked me out of my own house?
Dined at home”?	Ate at home?
Thou villain, what sayest thou?	You there, rogue, what do you have to say about that?
Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home.	I swear, sir, you did not eat at home.
Were not my doors locked up and I shut out?	My doors were locked and I was shut out, right?
Perdie, your doors were locked, and you shut out.	By God, your doors were locked and you were shut out.
And did not she herself revile me there?	And she screamed at me, right?
Sans fable, she herself reviled you there.	No lie—she screamed at you.
Did not her kitchen maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?	And her cook yelled, mocked, and teased me, right?
And did not I in rage depart from thence?	And I departed in a rage, right?
In verity you did.—My bones bear witness, That since have felt the vigour of his rage.	You truly did.
It is no shame.	Good idea.
Alas, I sent you money to redeem you By Dromio here, who came in haste for it.	I gave it to Dromio, who rushed in for it.
Money by me!	You gave money to me?
Went’st not thou to her for a purse of ducats?	Didn’t you go to her for a purse full of ducats?
He came to me, and I delivered it.	He did, and I gave it to him.
And I am witness with her that she did.	And I saw her do it.
God and the rope-maker bear me witness That I was sent for nothing but a rope.	I was sent for a rope!
Mistress, both man and master is possessed.	Mistress, both the man and his master are possessed.
I know it by their pale and deadly looks.	I can tell by how pale and deathlike they look.
They must be bound and laid in some dark room.	We must tie them up and leave them in some dark room.
I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.	My sweet husband, I did not lock you out.
And, gentle master, I received no gold.	And my sweet master, I received no gold.
But I confess, sir, that we were locked out.	But I agree, sir, that we were locked out.
Let him not come near me.	Keep him away from me!
More company!	We need more help!
The fiend is strong within him.	The devil in him is strong!
What, will you murder me?—Thou jailer, thou, I am thy prisoner.	jailer, i’m your prisoner.
Wilt thou suffer them To make a rescue?	are you going to let them break me out of jail?
Masters, let him go.	Gentlemen, let go of him.
He is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.	He’s my prisoner and you can’t have him.
Go, bind this man, for he is frantic too.	Tie up the servant, for he is mad as well.
He is my prisoner.	He’s my prisoner.
If I let him go, The debt he owes will be required of me.	If I let him go, I’ll have to pay his bail fees myself.
I will discharge thee ere I go from thee.	I’ll pay you.
Bear me forthwith unto his creditor, And, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.— Good Master Doctor, see him safe conveyed Home to my house.	Take me to the man my husband is in debt to.
O most unhappy day!	What a horrible day!
O most unhappy strumpet!	What a horrible slut!
Master, I am here entered in bond for you.	Master, I’m all tied up for you.
How idly do they talk!	The poor souls—how strangely they talk!
One Angelo, a goldsmith.	Angelo, the jeweler.
Do you know him?	Do you know him?
I know the man.	I know him.
Two hundred ducats.	Two hundred ducats.
Say, how grows it due?	For what?
Due for a chain your husband had of him.	For a necklace your husband had him make.
He did bespeak a chain for me but had it not.	He said he was going to buy me a necklace, but I never saw it.
I long to know the truth hereof at large.	I need to hear the truth about all this.
God for Thy mercy, they are loose again!	God have mercy on us!
And come with naked swords.	And they’ve got their swords unsheathed!

Away!	Let’s get out of here!
They’ll kill us.	They’ll kill us!
I see these witches are afraid of swords.	It looks like these witches are scared of swords.
She that would be your wife now ran from you.	The one who claims to be your wife just ran away from you.
I long that we were safe and sound aboard.	I wish we were safely on board our ship already.
Faith, stay here this night.	Look, let’s stay here tonight.
They will surely do us no harm.	Nobody will hurt us.
You saw they speak us fair, give us gold.	You see how kind everyone is to us, how they just hand us gold.
Methinks they are such a gentle nation that, but for the mountain of mad flesh	I think this country is so kind that if it weren’t for
that claims marriage of me, i could find in my heart to stay here still, and turn witch.	that mountain of insanity that wants to marry me, I could find it in my heart to stay here and become a witch myself.
I will not stay tonight for all the town.	I wouldn’t stay here tonight for the entire town.
Therefore away, to get our stuff aboard.	Go and get our stuff onto the ship.
How is the man esteemed here in the city?	What’s this man’s reputation like here in the city?
His word might bear my wealth at any time.	I’d trust him with everything I own.
Speak softly.	You’re right.
Tis so; and that self chain about his neck Which he forswore most monstrously to have.	And that necklace around his neck is the very one he swore he didn’t have!
Good sir, draw near to me.	Good sir, stay close to me.
Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum, Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.	So, tell people that you’re from Epidamnum–otherwise all your goods will be confiscated.
There is your money that I had to keep.	Here’s the money you asked me to hold.
Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host, And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.	Dromio, bring this money to the Centaur Inn, where we’re lodging, and wait there until I come.
Within this hour it will be dinnertime.	It’ll be lunchtime within an hour.
Till that, I’ll view the manners of the town, Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings, And then return and sleep within mine inn, For with long travel I am stiff and weary.	Until then, I’ll walk around town, peruse the markets, and gaze upon the buildings, and then I’ll return and sleep at the inn.
Get thee away.	Get going now.
Many a man would take you at your word And go indeed, having so good a mean.	Many men would take you literally and take off with all this money.
A trusty villain, sir, that very oft, When I am dull with care and melancholy, Lightens my humor with his merry jests.	Often, when I’m dulled by worry and melancholy, he lightens my mood with his merry pranks.
What, will you walk with me about the town And then go to my inn and dine with me?	Listen, will you walk with me around the town and then dine with me at the inn?
I think I had.	But if
I never did deny it.	I got it from you—I never said I didn’t.
Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.	Yes, you did, sir.
Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?	Who heard me do that?
These ears of mine, thou know’st did hear thee.	My own ears heard it, and you know it.
Fie on thee, wretch.	To hell with you!
Tis pity that thou liv’st To walk where any honest men resort.	It’s a shame that you walk the streets with all the honest men.

Be quiet, people.	Be quiet, people!
Wherefore throng you hither?	Why have you come here in such a mob?
To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.	To get my poor, mad husband out from inside there.
Let us come in, that we may bind him fast And bear him home for his recovery.	Let us in so we can tie him up tight and bring him home to recover.
How long hath this possession held the man?	How long has he been possessed like this?
This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad, And much different from the man he was.	This week he was sad, moody, and depressed and very different from his usual self.
But till this afternoon his passion Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.	But it wasn’t until this afternoon that he broke out into violence.
Hath not else his eye Stray’d his affection in unlawful love, A sin prevailing much in youthful men Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing?	That’s a sin young men often commit because they allow their eyes to wander.
Which of these sorrows is he subject to?	Which of these bad things happened to him?
You should for that have reprehended him.	You should have reprimanded him for that.
Why, so I did.	I did.
Ay, but not rough enough.	Fine, but you weren’t harsh enough.
Haply in private.	You scolded him in private?
And in assemblies too.	And in public too.

Alone, it was the subject of my theme; In company I often glancèd it.	He couldn’t eat without me talking about it.
Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.	All I ever did was tell him how hurtful and bad it was.
And thereof came it that the man was mad.	And that’s why he went crazy.
The venom clamors of a jealous woman Poisons more deadly than a mad dog’s tooth.	A jealous woman’s poisonous ranting is worse than the bite of a rabid dog.
Thou sayst his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings.	You seasoned his food with screams.
Thou sayest his sports were hinderd by thy brawls.	Fever, as we know, is a kind of madness.
In food, in sport, and life-preserving rest To be disturbed, would mad or man or beast.	Ruining his meals, his enjoyment, and his sleep would drive any man or beast mad.
The consequence is, then, thy jealous fits Have scared thy husband from the use of wits.	What I’m saying is, your jealousy has pushed your husband away from his sanity.
Good people, enter and lay hold on him.	Gentlemen, go in there and grab him.
Then let your servants bring my husband forth.	Then have your servants bring him out.
It is a branch and parcel of mine oath, A charitable duty of my order.	Healing is part and parcel of my religious vows; it is a charitable duty my order performs.
Therefore depart and leave him here with me.	Therefore, depart, and leave him here with me.
Be quiet and depart.	Be quiet and depart.
Thou shalt not have him.	You’re not going to take him.
Complain unto the Duke of this indignity.	Go lodge a complaint about this with the duke.
Come, go.	Come with me.
I will fall prostrate at his feet And never rise until my tears and prayers Have won his grace to come in person hither And take perforce my husband from the Abbess.	I’ll fall at his feet and lie there until my pleading and crying convinces the duke to come here and force my husband to leave this abbey.

See where they come.	Here they come.
We will behold his death.	We will watch the execution.
Kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey.	Kneel down to the duke before he passes by the abbey.
Yet once again proclaim it publicly, If any friend will pay the sum for him, He shall not die; so much we tender him.	One more time, we proclaim this publicly: If anyone will pay this man’s bail, he will not be put to death.
Justice, most sacred duke, against the Abbess.	Duke, the abbess has wronged me and I seek justice.
She is a virtuous and a reverend lady.	She’s a virtuous and holy lady.
It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.	She can’t possibly have done you any wrong.
Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.	So please, most gracious duke, order her to bring him out so we can get him some help.
Long since thy husband served me in my wars, And I to thee engaged a prince’s word, When thou didst make him master of thy bed, To do him all the grace and good I could.	And when you married him and made him the master of your bed, I gave you my word that I would do everything I possibly could for him.
Peace, fool.	Shut up, fool!
Thy master and his man are here, And that is false thou dost report to us.	Your master and his servant are here.
Mistress, upon my life I tell you true.	Mistress, I swear on my life that it’s true.
I have not breathed almost since I did see it.	It was just moments ago.
He cries for you, and vows, if he can take you, To scorch your face and to disfigure you.	He’s crying out for you and swears he’ll burn your face and disfigure you if he can get ahold of you.
Ay me, it is my husband.	Oh, my, it’s my husband.
Witness you That he is borne about invisible.	Look, he can become invisible.
Even now we housed him in the abbey here, And now he’s there, past thought of human reason.	Just now we put him in the abbey over here, and now he’s over there.
Even for the blood That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.	In exchange for the blood I shed for you then, I ask you for justice now.
Beyond imagination is the wrong That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.	The things she has shamelessly hurled on me are beyond imagination.
This day, great duke, she shut the doors upon me While she with harlots feasted in my house.	Today, great duke, she locked me out of my house and feasted there with whores.
A grievous fault.—Say, woman, didst thou so?	That’s terrible!
No, my good lord.	No, my good lord.
Myself, he, and my sister Today did dine together.	I ate with him and my sister.
So befall my soul As this is false he burdens me withal.	Damn my soul if these accusations are true!
Ne'er may I look on day, nor sleep on night But she tells to your Highness simple truth.	If she’s lying, I pray that I never sleep again at night or wake up during the day.
O perjured woman!	Oh, lying woman!
My liege, I am advisèd what I say, Neither disturbed with the effect of wine, Nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire, Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.	My lord, I know what I’m saying.
That goldsmith there, were he not packed with her, Could witness it, for he was with me then, Who parted with me to go fetch a chain, Promising to bring it to the Porpentine, Where Balthasar and I did dine together.	He left to fetch a necklace and he promised to bring it to the Porcupine, where I was dining with Balthasar.
Our dinner done and he not coming thither, I went to seek him.	He hadn’t arrived by the time we finished eating, so I went out looking for him.
In the street I met him, And in his company that gentleman.	I met him in the street—he was there with that man.
By th' way we met My wife, her sister, and a rabble more Of vile confederates.	On the way, we came across my wife, her sister, and their gang of vile associates.
Along with them They brought one Pinch, a hungry, lean-faced villain, A mere anatomy, a mountebank, A threadbare juggler, and a fortune-teller, A needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch, A living dead man.	One of them was a man named Pinch: a hungry, narrow-faced villain; a skeleton; a fraud; a raggedy magician and fortune-teller; a needy, hollow-eyed, emaciated wretch; a walking corpse.
This pernicious slave, Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer, And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,	He pretended to be some kind of sorcerer, and he gazed in my eyes and took my pulse.
But had he such a chain of thee or no?	They left me and my servant there, tied together.
He had, my lord, and when he ran in here, These people saw the chain about his neck.	He did, my lord.
I never saw the chain, so help me heaven, And this is false you burden me withal.	I never saw the necklace, so help me heaven!
Why, what an intricate impeach is this!	Why, what a complicated case this is!
Soon at five o'clock, Please you, I’ll meet with you upon the mart And afterward consort you till bedtime.	it pleases you, I’ll meet you in the marketplace at five and will keep you company until bedtime.
My present business calls me from you now.	Right now, my pressing business calls me away.
Farewell till then.	Farewell till then.
I will go lose myself And wander up and down to view the city.	I will go lose myself, wandering up and down throughout the city.
Sir, I commend you to your own content.	Sir, I leave you to your own contentment.
He that commends me to mine own content Commends me to the thing I cannot get.	He leaves me to my own contentment, but that’s the one thing I cannot find.
I to the world am like a drop of water That in the ocean seeks another drop, Who, falling there to find his fellow forth, Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself.	Out in the world, I’m like a drop of water, trying to find a drop that matches in the whole wide ocean.
So I, to find a mother and a brother, In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.	In order to find a mother and a brother, I too have lost myself, unhappily.
How chance thou art returned so soon?	How is it that you’ve come back so soon?

The capon burns; the pig falls from the spit; The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell; My mistress made it one upon my cheek.	The chicken is burning, the pig is overcooked, the clock has already struck twelve, and my mistress has clocked me one on the cheek.
You say he dined at home; the goldsmith here Denies that saying.	ate at home, but the jeweler says he didn’t.
Sir, he dined with her there, at the Porpentine.	Sir, he ate with this woman at the Porcupine.
He did, and from my finger snatched that ring.	He did, and he snatched my ring right off my finger.
Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.	That’s true, my lord: I did get this ring from her.
Saw’st thou him enter at the abbey here?	Did you see him enter this abbey?
As sure, my liege, as I do see your Grace.	As clearly as I see you, my lord.
I think you are all mated or stark mad.	I think you’re all either bewildered or stark raving mad.
Most mighty duke, vouchsafe me speak a word.	Mighty duke, please allow me to say something.
Haply I see a friend will save my life And pay the sum that may deliver me.	I think I see a friend who will pay my bail and save my life.
Within this hour I was his bondman sir, But he, I thank him, gnawed in two my cords.	I was bound to him an hour ago, sir, but thankfully he chewed through our ropes.
Now am I Dromio, and his man, unbound.	Now I’m Dromio and no longer attached to him.
I am sure you both of you remember me.	I’m sure you both remember me.
You are not Pinch’s patient, are you, sir?	You’re not one of Pinch’s patients, are you, sir?
Why look you strange on me?	Why are you looking at me so strangely?
you know me well.	You know me well.
I never saw you in my life till now.	I never saw you before in my life.
O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last, And careful hours with time’s deformèd hand Have written strange defeatures in my face.	Oh, grief has transformed me since the last time you saw me.
But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?	But tell me this: don’t you know my voice?
Neither.	No.
Dromio, nor thou?	Don’t you, Dromio?
No, trust me, sir, nor I. I am sure thou dost.	No sir, trust me, I do not.
Not know my voice!	You don’t know my voice?
O time’s extremity, Hast thou so crack’d and splitted my poor tongue In seven short years that here my only son Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares?	Have you mangled my tongue so badly in these seven short years that my only son can no longer recognize my weak, sorrow-ravaged voice?
Though now this grainèd face of mine be hid In sap-consuming winter’s drizzled snow, And all the conduits of my blood froze up, Yet hath my night of life some memory, My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left, My dull deaf ears a little use to hear.	But I still have a little memory left, and there’s still some fire in my eyes; my dull, deaf ears can still hear a little.
All these old witnesses—I cannot err— Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.	All these aging faculties tell me—and I cannot be wrong—that you are my son, Antipholus.
I never saw my father in my life.	I never saw my father in my life.
But seven years since, in Syracusa, boy, Thou know’st we parted.	You know that we parted only seven years ago, in Syracuse.
I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.	Your old age and the prospect of death are making you imagine things.
Most mighty duke, behold a man much wronged.	Mighty duke, look here and see a man who’s been treated most terribly!
I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.	Either my eyes deceive me, or I see two husbands.
I, sir, am Dromio.	I, sir, am Dromio.
Command him away.	Command this man to leave.
I, sir, am Dromio.	I, sir, am Dromio.
Please, let me stay.	Pray, let me stay.
O, my old master.—Who hath bound him here?	Oh, my old master!—Who tied him up?
Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds And gain a husband by his liberty.— Speak, old Egeon, if thou be’st the man That hadst a wife once called Emilia, That bore thee at a burden two fair sons.	Tell us, old Egeon: are you the man who once had a wife named Emilia, who gave birth to two fair sons?
O, if thou be’st the same Egeon, speak, And speak unto the same Emilia.	Oh, if you are the same Egeon, speak now, and speak to that same Emilia!
Why, here begins his morning story right; These two Antipholuses, these two so like, And these two Dromios, one in semblance— Besides her urging of her wreck at sea— These are the parents to these children, Which accidentally are met together.	These two Antipholuses, who look so alike—and these two Dromios, who seem to have the same face—and her story of being shipwrecked—why, these two are the parents of these children and have been reunited by accident.
If I dream not, thou art Emilia.	If I’m not dreaming, you are Emilia.
If thou art she, tell me where is that son That floated with thee on the fatal raft?	If it’s really you, tell me what happened to our son, who floated away with you on that deadly raft.
Corinth first.	Antipholus, aren’t you originally from Corinth?
Stay, stand apart.	Wait, don’t stand next to each other.
I know not which is which.	I can’t tell who’s who.
I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord.	I came from Corinth, Your Highness.
And I with him.	And I came with him.
Brought to this town by that most famous warrior Duke Menaphon, your most renownèd uncle.	Your renowned uncle, Duke Menaphon, the famous soldier, brought me here.
Which of you two did dine with me today?	Which of you two ate lunch with me today?
I, gentle mistress.	I did, kind lady.
And are not you my husband?	And you’re my husband, right?
That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.	That’s the necklace I gave you, sir.
I think it be, sir.	I think it is, sir.
I deny it not.	I don’t deny it.
And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.	And you, sir, had me arrested over that necklace.
I think I did, sir.	I think I did, sir.
I deny it not.	I don’t deny it.
I sent you money, sir, to be your bail By Dromio, but I think he brought it not.	I sent Dromio to you with money for bail, but I don’t think he brought it to you.
No, none by me.	No, he didn’t get any by me.
This purse of ducats I received from you, And Dromio my man did bring them me.	I got this purse full of money from you, and my Dromio brought it to me.
These ducats pawn I for my father here.	I want to use this money to set my father free.
It shall not need.	That’s not necessary.
Thy father hath his life.	I’m going to let him live.
Sir, I must have that diamond from you.	Sir, I must get that diamond ring back from you.
There, take it; and much thanks for my good cheer.	There, take it, and thanks for taking such good care of me.
Renownèd duke, vouchsafe to take the pains To go with us into the abbey here And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes, And all that are assembled in this place That by this sympathizèd one day’s error Have suffered wrong.	Renowned duke, please join us in the abbey, where we will discuss at length all that has happened to us.
Go, keep us company, And we shall make full satisfaction.— Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail Of you, my sons, and till this present hour My heavy burden ne'er deliverèd.— The Duke, my husband, and my children both, And you, the calendars of their nativity, Go to a gossips' feast, and go with me.	Duke Solinus, my husband, and both my children—and you two Dromios, who marked the day of my sons' births with your own—come into the abbey with me for a new christening.
After so long grief, such nativity!	After such a long period of grief, we will have such a celebration!
With all my heart I’ll gossip at this feast.	With all my heart, I’ll join you.
Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embarked?	Dromio, what stuff of mine did you put on a ship?
Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur.	The stuff you had at the Centaur, sir.
He speaks to me.—I am your master, Dromio.	I’m your master, Dromio.
There is a fat friend at your master’s house That kitchened me for you today at dinner.	You have a fat friend at your master’s house: she took care of me in the kitchen today, thinking I was you.
She now shall be my sister, not my wife.	I guess now she’s going to be my sister-in-law and not my wife.
Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother: I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth.	I think you’re my mirror, not my brother.
Will you walk in to see their gossiping?	Do you want to go in and join the party?
Not I, sir.	After you, sir.
You are my elder.	You’re older than me.
That’s a question.	That’s a good point.
How shall we try it?	How can we tell which of us is the oldest?
We’ll draw cuts for the signior.	We’ll draw straws.
Till then, lead thou first.	Meanwhile, after you.
Nay, then, thus: We came into the world like brother and brother, And now let’s go hand in hand, not one before another.	We came into the world as brother and brother, so now let’s enter hand in hand—not one before the other.
Stop in your wind, sir.	Hold on a second.
Tell me this, I pray: Where have you left the money that I gave you?	Answer me this, please: where’s the money I gave you?
O, sixpence, that I had o' Wednesday last To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?	Oh, the sixpence you gave me last Wednesday to buy leather goods for my mistress?
The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.	The saddle maker has it, sir—I didn’t keep it.
I am not in a sportive humor now.	I’m not in a joking mood.
Tell me, and dally not: where is the money?	Tell me right now and stop fooling: where’s the money?
We being strangers here, how dar’st thou trust So great a charge from thine own custody?	We’re strangers here.
I pray you, jest, sir, as you sit at dinner.	Please, sir; crack jokes over lunch.
Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock, And strike you home without a messenger.	I should think that your appetite would act like a clock (as mine does) and bring you home on its own, without the need for a messenger.
Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season.	That’s enough, Dromio, please.
Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.	This isn’t a good moment for jokes—save them till a happier time.
Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?	Where’s the gold I gave you?
To me, sir?	Gave me, sir?
Why, you gave no gold to me!	You didn’t give me any gold.
Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness, And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge.	Tell me what you’ve done with the money I entrusted to you.
My charge was but to fetch you from the mart Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner.	The only thing that I’ve been entrusted with was getting you from the market and bringing you to your house, the Phoenix, for lunch.
My mistress and her sister stays for you.	My mistress and her sister are waiting for you.
Now, as I am a Christian, answer me In what safe place you have bestowed my money, Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours That stands on tricks when I am undisposed.	Tell me where you’ve stowed away my money, or I swear I’ll break that comical head of yours for goofing when I’m not in the mood.
Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?	Where are the thousand
Thy mistress' marks?	Your mistress’s marks?
what mistress, slave, hast thou?	What mistress do you have?
What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face, Being forbid?	What, are you going to mock me to my face when I told you not to?
There, take you that, sir knave.	There, take that, you scoundrel!
What mean you, sir?	What are you doing?
For God’s sake, hold your hands.	Stop, for God’s sake!
Nay, an you will not, sir, I’ll take my heels.	Well, if you don’t, then I’m out of here.
Upon my life, by some device or other The villain is o'erraught of all my money.	I swear, somehow the fool has been cheated out of all my money.
They say this town is full of cozenage, As nimble jugglers that deceive the eye, Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind, Soul-killing witches that deform the body, Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks, And many suchlike liberties of sin.	They say that this town is full of deception—illusionists that can fool the eye, dark sorcerers who can bewitch your mind, soul-killing witches who can disfigure your body, disguised swindlers, fast-talking fakers, and all kinds of other unchecked sins.
Neither my husband nor the slave returned That in such haste I sent to seek his master?	Neither my husband nor the slave has returned, even though I sent the slave off running.
Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.	Surely, Luciana, it’s already two o'clock.
Perhaps some merchant hath invited him, And from the mart he’s somewhere gone to dinner.	Maybe some merchant at the marketplace invited him home for lunch.
Good sister, let us dine and never fret.	Sister, let’s eat and stop worrying.
A man is master of his liberty; Time is their master, and when they see time They’ll go or come.	A man is master of his own freedom: time is his only master, and when the right moment comes along, he’ll come or go as he pleases.
If so, be patient, sister.	If this is so, be patient, sister.
Why should their liberty than ours be more?	Why should men be more free than women?
Because their business still lies out o' door.	Because their business lies outside the home.
Why, headstrong liberty is lashed with woe.	Why, too much freedom leads to woe.
Then let your will attend on their accords.	Therefore, you should obey their wishes.
This servitude makes you to keep unwed.	It’s this servantlike mentality that’s keeping you unmarried.
Not this, but troubles of the marriage bed.	No, that’s not it—it’s because of what happens in the marriage bed.
But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.	But if you were married, you’d wield some influence.
Ere I learn love, I’ll practice to obey.	Before I learn how to love, I’ll learn how to follow orders.
How if your husband start some otherwhere?	What if your husband strays elsewhere?
Till he come home again, I would forbear.	I’d endure it until he came home again.
Patience unmoved!	Now that’s patience!
No marvel though she pause; They can be meek that have no other cause.	No wonder she’s waiting to get married.
A wretched soul, bruised with adversity We bid be quiet when we hear it cry, But were we burdened with like weight of pain, As much or more we should ourselves complain.	When we’re faced with a wretched person, bruised and crying with hardship, we try to get them to shush up.
So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee, With urging helpless patience would relieve me; But, if thou live to see like right bereft, This fool-begged patience in thee will be left.	But if you live to see yourself similarly denied your rights, this foolish patience will abandon you.
Well, I will marry one day, but to try.	Well, I’ll get married one day, just to see.
Say, is your tardy master now at hand?	Tell me, is your tardy master close at hand?
Know’st thou his mind?	Do you know his plans?
But say, I prithee, is he coming home?	But please, tell me: is he coming home?
It seems he hath great care to please his wife.	It seems he has taken great care to please his wife.
Why, mistress, sure my master is horn mad.	Why, mistress, my master is as angry as a bull with horns.
Horn mad, thou villain!	You bastard!
I mean not cuckold mad, But sure he is stark mad.	I don’t mean he’s
My mistress, sir,” quoth I.	My mistress,” I said.
Hang up thy mistress!	Damn your mistress!
Quoth my master.	My master said it.
I know,” quoth he, “no house, no wife, no mistress.” So that my errand, due unto my tongue, I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders, For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.	I don’t know,” he said, “any house, wife, or mistress.” My message, which was supposed to be delivered with my mouth, ended up being carried back home by my shoulders.
Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.	Go back again, slave, and bring him home.
Go back again and be new beaten home?	Go back again, to be beaten home again?
For God’s sake, send some other messenger.	For God’s sake, send somebody else.
Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.	Go back, slave, or I’ll knock you one across the head.
Hence, prating peasant!	Get out of here, you blathering peasant!
Fetch thy master home.	Bring your master home.
You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither.	You kick me out, he kicks me back.
If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.	Look at you!
Fie, how impatience loureth in your face.	You have impatience all over your face.
His company must do his minions grace, Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.	He feels the need to grace all his other tramps with his presence while I sit at home starving for a smile from him.
Hath homely age th' alluring beauty took From my poor cheek?	Has homely old age taken the alluring beauty from my poor cheeks?
Barren my wit?	Have I lost my wit?
My decayèd fair A sunny look of his would soon repair.	One smile from him would repair my decayed beauty.
But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale And feeds from home.	But like an unruly deer, he’s always trespassing past the park borders and straying away from home to feed in new pastures.
Poor I am but his stale.	I am nothing but a poor, used fool.
Self-harming jealousy, fie, beat it hence.	Drive it out of you.
I know his eye doth homage otherwhere, Or else what lets it but he would be here?	I know his eyes are worshiping some other woman, or why wouldn’t he be here?
Sister, you know he promised me a chain.	Sister, you know he promised to give me a necklace.
Would that alone o' love he would detain, So he would keep fair quarter with his bed.	I would gladly do without that if he would only stay faithful to me.
I see the jewel best enamelèd Will lose his beauty.	Even the best jewel can be tarnished.
Yet the gold bides still That others touch, and often touching will Wear gold; yet no man that hath a name By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.	And no man with a reputation will tarnish that name with lies and bad behavior.
Since that my beauty cannot please his eye, I’ll weep what’s left away, and weeping die.	Since my beauty no longer pleases my husband, I’ll weep away what’s left and then die with weeping.
How many fond fools serve mad jealousy!	How many infatuated people go mad with jealousy!
Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall, And by the doom of death end woes and all.	Give me the death sentence and end all my troubles.
For, since the mortal and intestine jars 'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us, It hath in solemn synods been decreed Both by the Syracusians and ourselves, To admit no traffic to our adverse towns.	Ever since these deadly conflicts erupted between your violent countrymen and ours, both you Syracusians and we Ephesians have held serious councils and decided not to permit any travel between our two hostile towns.
Nay, more, if any born at Ephesus Be seen at any Syracusian marts and fairs; Again, if any Syracusian born Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies, His goods confiscate to the Duke’s dispose, Unless a thousand marks be levièd To quit the penalty and to ransom him.	No–the law goes further: if anyone born in Ephesus is seen in Syracuse’s marketplaces or if anyone born in Syracuse comes to Ephesus, that man dies, and his possessions will be confiscated by the Duke, unless he can raise a thousand marks to pay the penalty and ransom himself.
Thy substance, valued at the highest rate, Cannot amount unto a hundred marks; Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.	Therefore, by law, you are condemned to die.
The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up Safe at the Centaur, and the heedful slave Is wandered forth, in care to seek me out.	The gold I gave Dromio is safe and sound at the Centaur, and the inn host says that Dromio has left and is looking for me.
By computation and mine host’s report, I could not speak with Dromio since at first I sent him from the mart.	I haven’t spoken to him since I sent him away from the marketplace earlier.
See, here he comes.	Here he comes.
How now, sir?	So, sir.
is your merry humor altered?	Are you over your ridiculous mood?
You know no Centaur?	You never heard of the Centaur?
You received no gold?	You weren’t given any gold?
Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?	Your mistress sent for me to come to dinner?
My house was at the Phoenix?	The Phoenix is my house?
Wast thou mad, That thus so madly thou didst answer me?	Were you mad when you spoke to me so madly?
What answer, sir?	Said what, sir?
When spake I such a word?	When did I say all that?
I did not see you since you sent me hence, Home to the Centaur with the gold you gave me.	I haven’t seen you since you sent me to the Centaur with the gold you gave me.
Villain, thou didst deny the gold’s receipt And told’st me of a mistress and a dinner, For which, I hope, thou felt’st I was displeased.	And I hope you realized I wasn’t very happy about it.
I am glad to see you in this merry vein.	I’m glad to see you in such a merry mood.
What means this jest?	But what’s the joke?
I pray you, master, tell me?	Please, master, tell me.
Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?	What, are you mocking me to my face?
Think’st thou I jest?	Here.
Hold, take thou that and that.	Take that, and that!
Hold, sir, for God’s sake!	Stop, sir, for God’s sake!
Now your jest is earnest.	Now this joke has turned serious.
Upon what bargain do you give it me?	Why are you doing this?
Because that I familiarly sometimes Do use you for my fool and chat with you, Your sauciness will jest upon my love And make a common of my serious hours.	Just because I act familiar with you sometimes and let you fool around and joke with me, you try to take advantage of my affection.
Sconce” call you it?	You call it my “ Don’t you know?
Shall I tell you why?	Should I tell you why?
Well, sir, I thank you.	Well, thank you.
Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing.	Because you gave me something for nothing.
I’ll make you amends next, to give you nothing for something.	Next time I’ll give you nothing for something.
But say, sir, is it dinnertime?	Is it lunchtime?
In good time, sir, what’s that?	What would that be?
Basting.	A basting.
Well, sir, then ’twill be dry.	Well, then it will be dry.
If it be, sir, I pray you, eat none of it.	If it is, I suggest you don’t eat it.
Your reason?	Why not?
Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another dry basting.	Because it will make you angry, and that will get me another beating.
Well, sir, learn to jest in good time.	Well, learn to make jokes at the appropriate time.
There’s a time for all things.	There’s a time for all things.
I durst have denied that before you were so choleric.	Before you got so angry, I never would have thought that.
By what rule, sir?	Why not?
Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of Father Time himself.	I’ll tell you: it’s because of a law as plain as Father Time’s bald head.
Let’s hear it.	Let’s hear it.
There’s no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature.	There may be a time for everything, but no man who has gone bald naturally can get his hair back.
Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is, so plentiful an excrement?	Why is Time so cheap about giving out hair?
Why, but there’s many a man hath more hair than wit.	But a lot of men have more hair than intelligence.
Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.	So then, you must think that hairy men are honest and simpleminded.
For what reason?	Two reasons.
For two, and sound ones too.	And good ones, too.
Nay, not sound, I pray you.	Not good ones, please.
Sure ones, then.	Then sure ones.
Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.	No, not sure ones when we’re talking about something unsure.
Certain ones, then.	Then certain ones.
Name them.	Name them.
The one, to save the money that he spends in tiring; the other, that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge.	One, so they can save the money they spent on hairstyling, and two, so that when their hair falls out it doesn’t land in their dinner.
You would all this time have proved there is no time for all things.	You were supposed to be proving that there isn’t time for everything.
Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald and therefore, to the world’s end, will have bald followers.	Then I’ll change it to this: Father Time himself is bald, so for all time there will be bald men.
The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow That never words were music to thine ear, That never object pleasing in thine eye, That never touch well welcome to thy hand, That never meat sweet-savored in thy taste, Unless I spake, or looked, or touched, or carved to thee.	There was a time when you’d freely tell me that words were never music to your ear unless I said them, that objects never pleased your eye unless I showed them to you, that touches never pleased your hands unless they were my touches, and that food never tasted sweet to you unless I had prepared it.
How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it That thou art thus estranged from thyself?	How is it, my husband—oh, how is it—that you have become a stranger to yourself?
Ah, do not tear away thyself from me!	Ah, don’t tear yourself away from me!
I know you not.	I don’t know you.
When were you wont to use my sister thus?	Why are you treating my sister like this?
She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.	She sent Dromio to bring you home for lunch.
By Dromio?	Dromio?
By thee; and this thou didst return from him: That he did buffet thee and, in his blows, Denied my house for his, me for his wife.	And this is what you told me he said: that he beat you and pretended his house wasn’t his and I wasn’t his wife.
Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?	Did you talk with this woman?
What is the course and drift of your compact?	What kind of scheme do you have going together?
I, sir?	Me, sir?
I never saw her till this time.	I never saw her till now.
Villain, thou liest; for even her very words Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.	You said those exact things to me back in the marketplace.
I never spake with her in all my life.	I never talked with her in my life.
What, was I married to her in my dream?	What, was I married to her in a dream?
Or sleep I now and think I hear all this?	Or am I asleep now and imagining all this?
What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?	What is making our eyes and ears act so strangely?
Until I know this sure uncertainty I’ll entertain the offered fallacy.	Until I know for sure, I’ll humor her.
Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.	Dromio, tell the servants to prepare for lunch.
O, for my beads!	Oh, I wish I had my rosary!
I cross me for a sinner.	I’ll cross myself.
This is the fairy land.	This must be some kind of fairyland.
O spite of spites!	Oh, spite of spites!
We talk with goblins, owls, and sprites: If we obey them not, this will ensue: They’ll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.	If we don’t obey them, they’ll suck the life out of us or pinch us black and blue.
Why prat’st thou to thyself and answer’st not?	Why are you mumbling to yourself instead of answering the order I gave you?
Dromio—thou, Dromio—thou snail, thou slug, thou sot.	Dromio, you drone, you snail, you slug, you idiot!
I am transformèd, master, am I not?	I’ve been transformed somehow, haven’t I, master?
I think thou art in mind, and so am I. Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.	No, master, I’ve been changed in both mind and body.
Tis true.	That’s true.
I am an ass; else it could never be But I should know her as well as she knows me.	I must be as stupid as an ass—that’s why I don’t know her, but she knows me.
Come, come, no longer will I be a fool, To put the finger in the eye and weep Whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn.	I won’t play the fool anymore and just cry while my husband and his man laugh at me.
Come, sir, to dinner.—Dromio, keep the gate.	Come, husband, let’s go to lunch.
Husband, I’ll dine above with you today, And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.	Husband, I’ll eat with you in private today and hear your confession about all the pranks you’ve pulled.
Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?	Am I on earth, in heaven, or in hell?
Known unto these, and to myself disguised!	know myself!
Master, shall I be porter at the gate?	Master, should I watch the door?
Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your pate.	Yes, and don’t let anyone come in, or else I’ll break your head.
Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause Why thou dep-artedst from thy native home And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus.	Well, Syracusian, tell us–briefly–why you left your hometown and came to Ephesus.
In Syracusa was I born, and wed Unto a woman happy but for me, And by me, had not our hap been bad.	And yet I would have made her happy had our luck not been so bad.
That very hour, and in the selfsame inn, A meaner woman was deliverèd Of such a burden, male twins, both alike.	In the same hour, and in the same inn, a poor woman also delivered identical twin boys.
Unwilling, I agreed.	Reluctantly, I agreed–alas!
Alas, too soon We came aboard.	Too quickly, we boarded a ship.
Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all; My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours.	Signior Angelo, please excuse us.
Say that I lingered with you at your shop To see the making of her carcanet, And that tomorrow you will bring it home.	Here’s the story we’ll tell her: that I was with you at your shop, watching you make her necklace, and that you’re going to deliver it tomorrow.
But here’s a villain that would face me down He met me on the mart, and that I beat him And charged him with a thousand marks in gold, And that I did deny my wife and house.— Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?	But here comes a scoundrel who says he saw me at the marketplace and that I beat on him, told him I’d given him a thousand marks in gold, and then lied about my wife and my house.
Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know.	Say what you want, but I know what I know.
I think thou art an ass.	I think you’re an ass.
You’re sad, Signior Balthasar.	Signior Balthasar, you look upset.
I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your welcome dear.	Your delicacies aren’t worth as much to me as your welcome is.
Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords.	Good food’s not a big deal—everyone can afford that.
And welcome more common, for that’s nothing but words.	And everyone can say “welcome,” which is just a word.
Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.	A little food and a huge welcome makes a joyous feast.
Ay, to a niggardly host and more sparing guest.	Sure, to a cheap host and an even cheaper guest.
But though my cates be mean, take them in good part.	But look, even if my dishes are poor, eat them with my best wishes.
Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.	You may come across better food, but not a warmer welcome.
But soft!	What’s this?
My door is lock’d.	My door is locked.
Maud, Bridget, Marian, Ciceley, Gillian, Ginn!	Maud, Bridget, Marian, Ciceley, Gillian, Ginn!
My master stays in the street.	My master is standing out in the street!
Who talks within there?	Who’s in there?
Ho, open the door.	Hey, open the door!
Wherefore?	A reason?
For my dinner.	So I can eat lunch.
I have not dined today.	I haven’t eaten today.
What art thou that keep’st me out from the house I owe?	Who do you think you are, keeping me out of my own house?
O villain, thou hast stolen both mine office and my name!	You’ve stolen both my job and my name!
O Lord, I must laugh.	Oh, Lord, this makes me laugh!
Have at you with a proverb: shall I set in my staff?	I’ll come at you with the old proverb: “Should I make myself at home?”
Do you hear, you minion?	Listen up, you slave.
You’ll let us in, I hope?	Are you going to let us in?
So, come, help.	Come, help me bang on the door, master.
Well struck!	Well done!
There was blow for blow.	We answered them, blow for blow.
Thou baggage, let me in.	You good-for-nothing, let me in.
Master, knock the door hard.	Master, knock hard upon the door.
You’ll cry for this, minion, if I beat the door down.	If I break the door down, slave, you’ll be sorry for this.
Are you there, wife?	Is that you, wife?
You might have come before.	You could have come sooner.
If you went in pain, master, this knave would go sore.	If she punishes you, master, she’s sure to punish me.
In debating which was best, we shall part with neither.	We argued about which was best, and now we won’t get either one.
You would say so, master, if your garments were thin.	And if your clothes were as thin as mine, you’d really feel the air.
Your cake there is warm within; you stand here in the cold.	The food inside is warm, but you’re out here freezing.
It would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold.	It would make any man as mad as a bull to be betrayed like this.
Go, fetch me something: I’ll break ope the gate.	Go get me something I can use to break down the door.
Here’s too much “out upon thee!” I pray thee, let me in.	I’ve had enough of this “off with you!” Come on, let me in!
Well, I’ll break in.	Well, I’m going to break in.
Go, borrow me a crow.	Go get me a crow.
A crow without feather?	A crow without feathers?
Master, mean you so?	Master, do you really mean that?
For a fish without a fin, there’s a fowl without a feather.—   Go, get thee gone.	I meant a crowbar.
Fetch me an iron crow.	Get going already.
Have patience, sir.	Be patient, sir!
O, let it not be so.	Don’t do this!
And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse Why at this time the doors are made against you.	All this suggests that she has a good reason for doing this to you.
Be ruled by me; depart in patience, And let us to the Tiger all to dinner, And about evening come yourself alone To know the reason of this strange restraint.	Let’s assume that she has a reason, which you don’t know yet: have faith that she’ll eventually explain why she shut the doors on you today.
You have prevailed.	You’re right—I’ll go quietly.
I will depart in quiet And, in despite of mirth, mean to be merry.	And even though I’m in a distasteful mood, I’ll work on being happy.
I know a wench of excellent discourse, Pretty and witty, wild and yet, too, gentle.	I know a terrific wench.
There will we dine.	We’ll eat at her place.
That chain will I bestow— Be it for nothing but to spite my wife— Upon mine hostess there.	I swear to her that I haven’t, but it doesn’t change anything.
I’ll meet you at that place some hour hence.	I’ll meet you there in an hour.
Do so.	Do that.
This jest shall cost me some expense.	This little prank of hers is going to cost me.
Shall, Antipholus, Even in the spring of love thy love-springs rot?	Is the building of your love already in ruins?
If you did wed my sister for her wealth, Then for her wealth’s sake use her with more kindness.	If you married my sister for her wealth, then for her wealth’s sake, treat her with more kindness.
What simple thief brags of his own attaint?	What foolish thief brags about his crimes?
Tis double wrong to truant with your bed And let her read it in thy looks at board.	It’s doubly wrong to cheat on your wife and then let her see the offense in your eyes.
Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve; We in your motion turn, and you may move us.	We follow in your orbit, and you have the power to move us.
Then, gentle brother, get you in again.	So, my sweet brother-in-law, go inside.
Sweet mistress—what your name is else I know not, Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine,—	Sweet mistress—I don’t know what other name to give you, or how you’ve figured out mine—you seem as
Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not Than our earth’s wonder, more than earth divine.	wise and graceful as the earth is wonderful and divine.
Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak.	Teach me how I should think and speak.
Against my soul’s pure truth why labour you To make it wander in an unknown field?	Why would you have me betray the truth of my emotions and make my love wander in some other direction?
Are you a god?	Are you a god?
would you create me new?	Are you trying to remake me?
Transform me, then, and to your power I’ll yield.	Go ahead, I’ll yield to your power.
But if that I am I, then well I know Your weeping sister is no wife of mine, Nor to her bed no homage do I owe.	But if I am myself, then I know for sure that your weeping sister is not my wife.
Far more, far more, to you do I decline.	I don’t owe her any duty—it’s you that I submit to.
O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note To drown me in thy sister’s flood of tears.	Oh, sweet mermaid, don’t command me to drown myself in the flood of your sister’s tears.
What, are you mad that you do reason so?	Are you insane, talking like this?
It is a fault that springeth from your eye.	Your eyes are playing tricks on you.
For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by.	That’s because you are near me, and you’re as dazzling as the sun.
Why call you me “love”?	Why are you calling me “love”?
Call my sister so.	Call my sister that.
Thy sister’s sister.	Your sister’s sister.
That’s my sister.	That’s my sister.
No, It is thyself, mine own self’s better part, Mine eye’s clear eye, my dear heart’s dearer heart, My food, my fortune, and my sweet hope’s aim, My sole earth’s heaven, and my heaven’s claim.	My food, my fortune, my sweetest hope, my heaven on earth, and my entrance to heaven.
All this my sister is, or else should be.	My sister is all those things, or else she should be.
Call thyself “sister,” sweet, for I am thee.	Call yourself your own sister, because I want you.
Give me thy hand.	Give me your hand.
O soft, sir!	Oh, wait, sir.
Hold you still.	Stay here.
I’ll fetch my sister to get her goodwill.	I’ll go get my sister and see what she thinks.
Why, how now, Dromio.	What’s going on, Dromio?
Where runn’st thou so fast?	Where are you running so fast?
Do you know me, sir?	Do you know me?
Am I Dromio?	Am I Dromio?
Am I your man?	Am I your servant?
Am I myself?	Am I myself?
The children thus disposed, my wife and I, Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fixed, Fastened ourselves at either end the mast And, floating straight, obedient to the stream, Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.	It carried us toward Corinth–or so we thought.
But ere they came,–O, let me say no more!	But before they reached us–let me say no more!
Thou art Dromio, thou art my man, thou art thyself.	You are Dromio, you are my servant, and you are yourself.
I am an ass, I am a woman’s man, and besides myself.	I’m an ass, I’m a woman’s servant, and I’m beside myself.
What woman’s man?	What woman’s servant?
And how besides thyself?	What do you mean, beside yourself?
What claim lays she to thee?	How does she claim to own you?
What is she?	I don’t mean that she wants me because  What’s she like?
Marry, sir, she’s the kitchen wench, and all grease, and I know not what use to put her to but to make a lamp of her and run from her by her own light.	The only thing I could do with her is to use all that oil as fuel in a lamp and then use that light to run away by.
I warrant her rags and the	Her
If she lives till doomsday, she’ll burn a week longer than the whole world.	Even if she lives till the end of the world, she’d keep burning an additional week.
What complexion is she of?	What’s her skin like?
Swart like my shoe, but her face nothing like so clean kept.	It’s dark, like my shoe.
That’s a fault that water will mend.	Some water will fix that.
No, sir, ’tis in grain; Noah’s flood could not do it.	No, it’s permanent.
What’s her name?	What’s her name?
Then she bears some breadth?	Nell.
She is spherical, like a globe.	She’s round, like a globe.
In what part of her body stands Ireland?	What part of her body is Ireland?
Marry, sir, in her buttocks.	Her bottom.
Faith, I saw it not, but I felt it hot in her breath.	Honestly, I didn’t see it, but I felt it in her hot breath.
Where America, the Indies?	Where’s America and the West Indies?
O, sir, upon her nose, all o'er-embellished with rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich aspect to the hot breath of Spain, who sent whole armadas of caracks to be ballast at her nose.	Oh, sir, on her nose, which is covered with pimples, sores, and red welts.
And, I think, if my breast had not been made of faith, and my heart of steel, She had transformed me to a curtal dog and made me turn i' th' wheel.	And I think that if I hadn’t been brave and strong, she would have turned me into a dog and made me her slave.
An if the wind blow any way from shore, I will not harbor in this town tonight.	If there’s enough wind for a ship to sail out tonight, I won’t spend tonight in this town.
If any bark put forth, come to the mart, Where I will walk till thou return to me.	If a ship’s leaving, come to the marketplace.
If every one knows us, and we know none, 'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack, and be gone.	If everyone here knows us but we don’t know anybody, it’s time, I think, for us to pack our bags and take off.
As from a bear a man would run for life, So fly I from her that would be my wife.	I’ll run from this woman who claims to be my wife as fast as I’d run from a bear.

What is your will that I shall do with this?	What do you want me to do with this?
I have made it for you.	Whatever you want—I made it for you.
Made it for me, sir?	Made it for me?
I bespoke it not.	I didn’t order it.
Not once, nor twice, but twenty times you have.	You did—not just once or twice, but twenty times.
You are a merry man, sir.	You’re a funny man, sir.
Fare you well.	Take care.
What I should think of this I cannot tell, But this I think: there’s no man is so vain That would refuse so fair an offered chain.	I don’t know what to think about this.
I’ll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay.	I’ll go wait for Dromio at the marketplace.
If any ship put out, then straight away.	If any ships are sailing, I’ll get right on one.
Even just the sum that I do owe to you Is growing to me by Antipholus.	Antipholus owes me the exact amount that I owe you.
At five o'clock I shall receive the money for the same.	At five o'clock he’s going to pay me for it.
Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house, I will discharge my bond and thank you too.	Please, come to his house with me.
Saving your merry humor, here’s the note How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat, The fineness of the gold, and chargeful fashion, Which doth amount to three-odd ducats more Than I stand debted to this gentleman.	The total due is about three ducats more than I owe this gentleman.
I pray you, see him presently discharged, For he is bound to sea, and stays but for it.	Please, pay him immediately.

Besides, I have some business in the town.	Besides, I have some business to take care of in town.

Well, sir, I will.	All right, sir, I will.
Have you the chain about you?	Do you have it with you?
Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain.	Listen, please, give me the necklace.
Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman, And I, to blame, have held him here too long.	The wind is right and it’s high tide, and I’ve delayed him a long time already.
Good Lord!	Good Lord!
You use this dalliance to excuse Your breach of promise to the Porpentine.	You’re using this as an excuse for not showing up at the Porcupine like you promised.
I should have chid you for not bringing it, But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.	I should have reprimanded you then for not bringing it, but you started fighting with me first.
The hour steals on.	It’s getting late.
I pray you, sir, dispatch.	Please, sir, hurry up.
You hear how he importunes me.	Antipholus, you hear how the man pleads with me.
The chain!	Give me the necklace!
Why, give it to my wife, and fetch your money.	Give it to my wife, and get your money.
Come, come.	Come, come.
You know I gave it you even now.	You know I gave it to you just now.
Either send the chain, or send me by some token.	Send the necklace to her, or send me with a token that will authorize her to pay me.
Fie, now you run this humor out of breath.	Damn it, this isn’t funny.
Come, where’s the chain?	Where’s the necklace?
I pray you, let me see it.	Let me see it.
I answer you?	Pay you?
What should I answer you?	What should I pay you?
The money that you owe me for the chain.	The money you owe me for the necklace.
I owe you none till I receive the chain.	I owe you nothing until I receive the necklace.
You know I gave it you half an hour since.	You know that I gave it to you a half hour ago.
You wrong me more, sir, in denying it.	You wrong me even more, sir, by denying it.
Consider how it stands upon my credit.	Consider how poorly this reflects on me.
Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.	I will.
I do,  This touches me in reputation.	This harms my reputation.
Consent to pay thee that I never had?— Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou dar’st.	Pay for something I never got?
Here is thy fee.	Go ahead, you fool.
Arrest him, officer.	Arrest me if you dare.
I would not spare my brother in this case If he should scorn me so apparently.	I would have my own brother arrested if he treated me so terribly.
I do arrest you, sir.	You’re under arrest, sir.
You hear the suit.	You hear the charges.
I do obey thee till I give thee bail.	I’ll obey you until I can make bail.
But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as dear As all the metal in your shop will answer.	But Angelo, you’ll pay for this, even if it costs all the precious metals in your jewelry shop.
Sir, sir, I will have law in Ephesus, To your notorious shame, I doubt it not.	Sir, the laws of Ephesus will be on my side, and you’ll be embarrassed.

Do not break off so, For we may pity though not pardon thee.	For we may take pity on you, even if we can’t pardon you.

Thus have you heard me severed from my bliss; That by misfortunes was my life prolonged To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.	It’s been my bad luck to remain alive long enough to be able to tell the sad stories of my own misfortunes.
And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for, Do me the favour to dilate at full What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.	And for the sake of those you grieve for, do me a favor: tell me the full story of what has happened to you and them, up to this point.
Our fraughtage, sir, I have conveyed aboard, and I have bought The oil, the balsamum and aqua vitae.	I’ve left our luggage on the ship, and I bought the oil, balm, and liquor you wanted.
Why, thou peevish sheep, What ship of Epidamnum stays for me?	You annoying idiot, what Epidamnum ship is waiting for me?
A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage.	A ship you sent me to find, to book passage out of here.
Thou drunken slave, I sent thee for a rope And told thee to what purpose and what end.	You drunken slave, I sent you for a rope, and I told you what to do with it.
You sent me for a rope’s end as soon.	Yeah, right—you sent me to get whipped.
You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.	You sent me to the port to find a ship.
I will debate this matter at more leisure And teach your ears to list me with more heed.	I’ll debate this with you later, and then I’ll teach you to listen more carefully.

That is where we dined, Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband.	Where that “sweetheart” said I was her husband!
She is too big, I hope, for me to compass.	She’s too much for me to handle.
Thither I must, although against my will, For servants must their masters' minds fulfill.	But I must go there, against my will: servants must fulfill their masters' wishes.
Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?	Oh, Luciana, did he tempt you like that?
Looked he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?	Sad or happy?
First he denied you had in him no right.	First, he said you had no right to him.
He meant he did me none; the more my spite.	He meant he did nothing right for me—which is true, unfortunately.
Then swore he that he was a stranger here.	Then he swore he was a stranger here.
Then pleaded I for you.	And that’s true—he  Then I pleaded for you.
And what said he?	And what did he say?
That love i begged for you he begged of me.	That he felt for me the love that I begged him to feel for you.
With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?	How did he try to persuade you to love him?
Have patience, I beseech.	Have some patience, please.
Who would be jealous, then, of such a one?	Then why be jealous of a person like that?
No evil lost is wailed when it is gone.	When an evil thing has been lost, no one cries.
Ah, but I think him better than I say, And yet would herein others' eyes were worse.	Oh, but I think of him more highly than I say I do—and I wish he looked worse in other women’s eyes.
My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.	My heart adores him, even though my tongue curses him.
How hast thou lost thy breath?	How did you lose your breath?
By running fast.	By running fast.
Where is thy master, Dromio?	Where’s your master, Dromio?
Is he well?	Is he all right?
No, he’s in Tartar limbo, worse than hell.	No, he’s in a place worse than hell.
The passages of alleys, creeks, and narrow lands; A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well, One that before the judgment carries poor souls to hell.	A backbiting friend, one who grabs people, who patrols the streets and passageways.
Why, man, what is the matter?	Speak, man, what’s the matter?
Tell me at whose suit.	Tell me, who had him arrested?
I know not at whose suit he is arrested well, But he’s in a suit of buff which ’rested him; that can I tell.	I don’t know who had him arrested, but the man that arrested him was in a suit of leather.
Go fetch it, sister.	Get it, sister.
This I wonder at, That he, unknown to me, should be in debt.	How could he be in debt without me knowing it?
Do you not hear it ring?	Don’t you hear it ring?
What, the chain?	What, the necklace?
No, no, the bell.	No, no, the bell.
Tis time that I were gone.	It’s time for me to go.
It was two ere I left him, and now the clock strikes one.	It was two o'clock when I left him, and now it’s one.
That did I never hear.	I’ve never heard of that.
Excellent well.	Of course.
You are a fishmonger.	You sell fish.
Not I, my lord.	No, not me, sir.
Then I would you were so honest a man.	In that case I wish you were as good a man as a fish seller.
Honest, my lord?	Good, sir?
Ay, sir.	Yes, sir.
To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man picked out of ten thousand.	Only one man in ten thousand is good in this world.
That’s very true, my lord.	That’s definitely true, my lord.
For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a good kissing carrion— Have you a daughter?	Since if the sun breeds maggots on a dead dog, kissing the corpse—by the way, do you have a daughter?
I have, my lord.	I do indeed, my lord.
Let her not walk i' th' sun.	Then by all means never let her walk in public.
Conception is a blessing, but, as your daughter may conceive—Friend, look to ’t.	Procreation is a good thing, but if your daughter gets pregnant … look out, friend.
Words, words, words.	A lot of words.
What is the matter, my lord?	And what is the subject?
Between who?	Between whom?
I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.	I mean, what do the words say?
Slanders, sir.	Oh, just lies, sir.
Into my grave.	Into my grave.
Indeed, that is out of the air.	Well, that’s certainly out of this world, all right.
You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will more willingly part withal—except my life, except my life, except my life.	You can’t take anything from me that I care less about—except my life, except my life, except my life.
Fare you well, my lord.	Good-bye, my lord.
You go to seek the Lord Hamlet.	You’re looking for Lord Hamlet.
There he is.	He’s right over there.
God save you, sir!	Thank you, sir.
My honored lord!	My lord!
My most dear lord!	My dear sir!
My excellent good friends!	Ah, my good old friends!
How dost thou, Guildenstern?	How are you, Guildenstern?
Ah, Rosencrantz!	And Rosencrantz!
Good lads, how do you both?	Boys, how are you both doing?
Happy, in that we are not overhappy.	Happy that we’re not too happy, lucky in being not too lucky.
On Fortune’s cap we are not the very button.	But you’re not down and out, either, are you?
Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her favors?	So you’re around Lady Luck’s waist?
Faith, her privates we.	Yes, we’re the privates in her army.
What news?	Anyway, what’s up?
But your news is not true.	But you’re wrong.
Let me question more in particular.	Let me ask you a particular question.
What have you, my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither?	What crimes have you committed to be sent here to this prison?
Prison, my lord?	Prison, my lord?
Denmark’s a prison.	Denmark’s a prison.
Then is the world one.	Then I guess the whole world is one.
A goodly one, in which there are many confines, wards, and dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.	Yes, quite a large one, with many cells and dungeons, Denmark being one of the worst.
We think not so, my lord.	We don’t think so, my lord.
Why, then, ’tis none to you, for there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.	Well, then it isn’t one to you, since nothing is really good or bad in itself—it’s all what a person thinks about it.
To me it is a prison.	And to me, Denmark is a prison.
Why then, your ambition makes it one.	That must be because you’re so ambitious.
Tis too narrow for your mind.	It’s too small for your large mind.
Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.	Dreams are a sign of ambition, since ambition is nothing more than the shadow of a dream.
A dream itself is but a shadow.	But a dream itself is just a shadow.
Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow’s shadow.	In fact, I consider ambition to be so light and airy that it’s only the shadow of a shadow.
Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows.	Then I guess beggars are the ones with bodies, while ambitious kings and heroes are just the shadows of beggars.
Shall we to th' court?	Should we go inside?
Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you, and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny.	Well, then, I thank you, though I’m such a beggar that even my thanks are not worth much.
Is it your own inclining?	Or was it just your whim, on your own initiative?
What should we say, my lord?	What should we say, my lord?
You were sent for, and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to color.	You were sent for.
I know the good king and queen have sent for you.	I know the king and queen sent for you.
To what end, my lord?	Why would they do that, my lord?
That you must teach me.	That’s what I want you to tell me.
My lord, we were sent for.	My lord, we were sent for.
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste Doth make the night joint laborer with the day?	Is something about to happen that warrants working this night and day?
Who is ’t that can inform me?	Who can explain this to me?
That can I.	I can.
I will tell you why.	Or at least I can describe the rumors.
Why did you laugh then, when I said “man delights not me”?	So why did you laugh when I said that men don’t interest me?
He that plays the king shall be welcome.	The one who plays the part of the king will be particularly welcome.
The adventurous knight shall use his foil and target, the lover shall not sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end his part in peace, the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle o' th' sear, and the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt for ’t.	The adventurous knight will wave around his sword and shield, the lover will be rewarded for his sighs, the crazy character can rant all he wants, the clown will make everybody laugh, and the lady character can say whatever’s on her mind, or I’ll stop the play.
What players are they?	Which troupe is it?
Even those you were wont to take delight in, the tragedians of the city.	The tragic actors from the city, the ones you used to enjoy so much.
How chances it they travel?	What are they doing on the road?
Their residence, both in reputation and profit, was better both ways.	They made more money and got more attention in the city.
I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation.	But things have changed there, and it’s easier for them on the road now.
Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city?	Are they as popular as they used to be when I lived in the city?
Are they so followed?	Do they attract big audiences?
No, indeed are they not.	No, not like before.
How comes it?	Why?
Do they grow rusty?	Are they getting rusty?
Nay, their endeavor keeps in the wonted pace.	No, they’re busy and as excellent as ever.
But there is, sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for ’t.	The problem is that they have to compete with a group of children who yell out their lines and receive outrageous applause for it.
These are now the fashion, and so berattle the common stages—so they call them—that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose quills and dare scarce come thither.	These child actors are now in fashion, and they’ve so overtaken the public theaters that society types hardly come at all, they’re so afraid of being mocked by the playwrights who write for the boys.
What, are they children?	What, you mean kid actors?
Who maintains 'em?	Who takes care of them?
How are they escoted?	Who pays their way?
Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing?	Will they stop working when their voices mature?
Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common players (as it is most like if their means are no better), their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession?	Aren’t the playwrights hurting them by making them upstage adult actors, which they are going to grow up and become?
Faith, there has been much to do on both sides, and the nation holds it no sin to tar them to controversy.	There’s been a whole debate on the topic.
There was, for a while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question.	For a while, no play was sold to the theaters without a big fight between the children’s playwright and the actors playing adult roles.
Is ’t possible?	Are you kidding?
Oh, there has been much throwing about of brains.	Oh, there’s been a lot of quarreling.
Do the boys carry it away?	And the boys are winning so far?
It is not very strange.	Actually, it’s not so unusual when you think about it.
For my uncle is King of Denmark, and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little.	My uncle is king of Denmark, and the same people who made fun of him while my father was still alive are now rushing to pay twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for miniature portraits of him.
Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find it out.	There’s something downright unnatural about it, if a philosopher stopped to think about it.
There are the players.	The actors are here.
Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore.	Gentlemen, welcome to Elsinore.
Your hands, come then.	Don’t be shy—shake hands with me.
Let me comply with you in this garb—lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you, must show fairly outwards, should more appear like entertainment than yours.	And if we don’t shake hands, when I act all nice to the players it will seem like I’m happier to see them than you.
You are welcome.	You are very welcome here.
But my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.	But still, my uncle-father and aunt-mother have got the wrong idea.
In what, my dear lord?	In what sense, my lord?
I am but mad north-north-west.	I’m only crazy sometimes.
When the wind is southerly, I know a hawk from a handsaw.	At other times, I know what’s what.
Well be with you, gentlemen.	Gentlemen, I hope you are well.
Hark you, Guildenstern, and you too—at each ear a hearer.	Listen, Guildenstern, and you too, Rosencrantz—listen as close as you can!
Happily he’s the second time come to them, for they say an old man is twice a child.	Yes, the second time around, since, as they say, old people become children again.
My lord, I have news to tell you.	My lord, I have news for you.
My lord, I have news to tell you.	My lord, I have news for you.
When Roscius was an actor in Rome—  The actors are come hither, my lord.	When Roscius was an actor in ancient Rome — The actors have arrived, my lord.
Buzz, buzz.	Yawn, snore.
Upon my honor— Then came each actor on his ass—	I swear— —each actor arrived on his ass.
Why,       Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?	Well,        Aren’t I right, Jephthah, old man?
If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I love passing well.	If you’re calling me Jephthah, my lord, I do have a daughter I love more than anything, yes.
What follows, then, my lord?	What is logical, then, my lord?
Why,	Why,
You are welcome, masters, welcome, all!—I am glad to see thee well.—Welcome, good friends.—O old friend?	Welcome, welcome to all of you.
What speech, my good lord?	Which speech, my lord?
But it was—as I received it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine—an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning.	But the critics and I found it to be an excellent play, with well-ordered scenes that were clever but not fancy.
One speech in it I chiefly loved.	I loved one speech in particular.
This is too long.	This speech is going on too long.
It shall to the barber’s, with your beard.—Prithee, say on.	We’ll have the barber trim it later, along with your beard.
The moblèd queen”?	The muffled queen”?
That’s good.	That’s good.
Moblèd queen” is good.	The muffled queen” is good.
Look whe'e he has not turned his color and has tears in ’s eyes.—Prithee, no more.	Look how flushed the actor is, with tears in his eyes.
My lord, I will use them according to their desert.	My lord, I will give them all they deserve.
God’s bodykins, man, much better.	Good heavens, man, give them more than that!
Use them after your own honor and dignity.	Treat them with honor and dignity.
The less they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty.	The less they deserve, the more your generosity is worth.
Take them in.	Lead them inside.
Come, sirs.	Come, everyone.
Follow him, friends.	Follow him, friends.
We’ll hear a play tomorrow.	We’ll watch a whole play tomorrow.
Ay, my lord.	Yes, my lord.
We’ll ha ’t tomorrow night.	Then we’ll see that tomorrow night.
You could, for a need, study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down and insert in ’t, could you not?	By the way, if I were to compose an extra speech of twelve to sixteen lines and stick it into the play, you could learn it by heart for tomorrow, right?
Ay, my lord.	Yes, my lord.
Very well.	Very well.
Follow that lord, and look you mock him not.	Follow that gentleman now, and be careful not to make fun of him.
My good friends, I’ll leave you till night.	My good friends, I’ll see you tomorrow.
You are welcome to Elsinore.	Welcome to Elsinore.
Good my lord.	Yes, my lord.
Now I am alone.	Now I’m alone.
Oh, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!	Oh, what a mean low-life I am!
And all for nothing— For Hecuba!	For Hecuba!
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands So by his father lost.	The ghost is definitely something to worry about.
In the most high and palmy state of Rome, A little ere the mightiest Julius fell, The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood, Disasters in the sun, and the moist star Upon whose influence Neptune’s empire stands Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.	In the high and mighty Roman Empire, just before the emperor Julius Caesar was assassinated, corpses rose out of their graves and ran through the streets of Rome speaking gibberish.
But soft, behold!	Wait, look!
Lo, where it comes again.	It has come again.
I’ll cross it though it blast me.—Stay, illusion!	I’ll meet it if it’s the last thing I do.
If thou hast any sound or use of voice, Speak to me.	If you have a voice or can make sounds, speak to me.
Am I a coward?	Am I a coward?
Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?	Pull off my beard?
Tweaks me by the nose?	Pinch my nose?
Who does me this?	Call me the worst liar?
Bloody, bawdy villain!	Bloody, inhuman villain!
Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!	Remorseless, treacherous, sex-obsessed, unnatural villain!
O vengeance!	Ah, revenge!
Why, what an ass am I!	What an ass I am.
Fie upon ’t, foh!	Damn it!
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak With most miraculous organ.	Murder has no tongue, but miraculously it still finds a way to speak.
If he do blench, I know my course.	If he becomes pale, I know what to do.
I’ll have grounds More relative than this.	I need better evidence than the ghost to work with.
The play’s the thing Wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the king.	The play’s the thing to uncover the conscience of the king.
And can you by no drift of conference Get from him why he puts on this confusion, Grating so harshly all his days of quiet With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?	And you can’t put your heads together and figure out why he’s acting so dazed and confused, ruining his peace and quiet with such dangerous displays of lunacy?
Did he receive you well?	Did he treat you well when you saw him?
Most like a gentleman.	Yes, in a very gentlemanly way.
Niggard of question, but of our demands Most free in his reply.	He didn’t ask questions, but answered ours at length.
Madam, it so fell out, that certain players We o'erraught on the way.	Madam, some actors happened to cross our paths on the way here.
They are about the court, And, as I think, they have already order This night to play before him.	They are here at court now, and I believe they’ve been told to give a performance for him tonight.
Tis most true, And he beseeched me to entreat your Majesties To hear and see the matter.	It’s true, and he asked me to beg you both to attend.
With all my heart, and it doth much content me To hear him so inclined.	It makes me very happy to hear he’s so interested.
Good gentlemen, give him a further edge, And drive his purpose on to these delights.	Gentlemen, please try to sharpen his interest even more, and let this play do him some good.
We shall, my lord.	We will, my lord.
I shall obey you.	Yes, I’ll go.
Madam, I wish it may.	I hope so too, Madam.
Ophelia, walk you here.	Ophelia, come here.—   I hear him coming.
Let’s withdraw, my lord.	Quick, let’s hide, my lord.
To die, to sleep— No more—and by a sleep to say we end The heartache and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to—’tis a consummation Devoutly to be wished!	Dying, sleeping—that’s all dying is—a sleep that ends all the heartache and shocks that life on earth gives us—that’s an achievement to wish for.
To die, to sleep.	To die, to sleep—to sleep, maybe to dream.
There’s the respect That makes calamity of so long life.	That’s the consideration that makes us stretch out our sufferings so long.
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, Th' oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely, The pangs of despised love, the law’s delay, The insolence of office, and the spurns That patient merit of th' unworthy takes, When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin?	After all, who would put up with all life’s humiliations—the abuse from superiors, the insults of arrogant men, the pangs of unrequited love, the inefficiency of the legal system, the rudeness of people in office, and the mistreatment good people have to take from bad—when you could simply take out your knife and call it quits?
Who would fardels bear, To grunt and sweat under a weary life, But that the dread of something after death, The undiscovered country from whose bourn No traveler returns, puzzles the will And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of?	Who would choose to grunt and sweat through an exhausting life, unless they were afraid of something dreadful after death, the undiscovered country from which no visitor returns, which we wonder about without getting any answers from and which makes us stick to the evils we know rather than rush off to seek the ones we don’t?
Good my lord, How does your honor for this many a day?	But  Hello, my lord, how have you been doing lately?
I humbly thank you.	Very well, thank you.
Well, well, well.	Well, well, well.
My lord, I have remembrances of yours That I have longèd long to redeliver.	My lord, I have some mementos of yours that I’ve been meaning to give back to you for a long time now.
I pray you now receive them.	Please take them.
There, my lord.	There, my lord.
Ha, ha, are you honest?	Ha ha, are you good?
My lord?	Excuse me?
Are you fair?	Are you beautiful?
What means your lordship?	My lord, what are you talking about?
That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty.	I’m just saying that if you’re good and beautiful, your goodness should have nothing to do with your beauty.
Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?	But could beauty be related to anything better than goodness?
Ay, truly, for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness.	Sure, since beauty’s power can more easily change a good girl into a whore than the power of goodness can change a beautiful girl into a virgin.
This was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives it proof.	This used to be a great puzzle, but now I’ve solved it.
I did love you once.	I used to love you.
Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.	You certainly made me believe you did, my lord.
I loved you not.	I didn’t love you.
I was the more deceived.	Then I guess I was misled.
Get thee to a nunnery.	Get yourself to a
I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in.	I am arrogant, vengeful, ambitious, with more ill will in me than I can fit into my thoughts, and more than I have time to carry it out in.
What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth and heaven?	Why should people like me be crawling around between earth and heaven?
We are arrant knaves, all.	Every one of us is a criminal.
Believe none of us.	Don’t believe any of us.
Go thy ways to a nunnery.	Hurry to a convent.
Where’s your father?	Where’s your father?
At home, my lord.	He’s at home, my lord.
Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool no where but in ’s own house.	Lock him in, so he can play the fool in his own home only.
Farewell.	Good-bye.
O, help him, you sweet heavens!	Oh, dear God, please help him!
Get thee to a nunnery, go.	Get yourself to a convent, at once.
Farewell.	Good-bye.
Farewell.	Good-bye.
Heavenly powers, restore him!	Dear God, please make him normal again!
I have heard of your paintings too, well enough.	I’ve heard all about you women and your cosmetics too.
God has given you one face and you make yourselves another.	God gives you one face, but you paint another on top of it.
You jig and amble, and you lisp, you nickname God’s creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance.	You dance and prance and lisp; you call God’s creations by pet names, and you excuse your sexpot ploys by pleading ignorance.
Go to, I’ll no more on ’t.	Come on, I won’t stand for it anymore.
It hath made me mad.	It’s driven me crazy.
I say, we will have no more marriages.	I hereby declare we will have no more marriage.
Those that are married already, all but one, shall live.	Whoever is already married (except one person I know) will stay married—all but one person.
The rest shall keep as they are.	Everyone else will have to stay single.
To a nunnery, go.	Get yourself to a convent, fast.
Love?	Love?
His affections do not that way tend.	His feelings don’t move in that direction.
Haply the seas and countries different With variable objects shall expel This something-settled matter in his heart, Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus From fashion of himself.	With any luck, the sea and new countries will push out these thoughts that have somehow taken root in his mind.
What think you on ’t?	What do you think of this plan?
It shall do well.	It should work.
But yet do I believe The origin and commencement of his grief Sprung from neglected love.—How now, Ophelia?	But I still believe that his madness was caused by unrequited love.—Hello, Ophelia.
You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.	You don’t have to tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
Let her be round with him, And I’ll be placed, so please you, in the ear Of all their conference.	I’ll hide and listen in.
If she find him not, To England send him or confine him where Your wisdom best shall think.	If she can’t find out what his secret is, then send him off to England or wherever you think best.
It shall be so.	That’s how we’ll do it, then.
If there be any good thing to be done That may to thee do ease and grace to me, Speak to me.	If there’s any good deed I can do that will bring you peace and me honor, speak to me.
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life Extorted treasure in the womb of earth, For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death, Speak of it.	Or if you’ve got some buried treasure somewhere, which they say often makes ghosts restless, then tell us about it.
Stay and speak!	Stay and speak!
Stop it, Marcellus.	Keep it from leaving, Marcellus.
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?	Should I strike it with my spear?
Do, if it will not stand.	Yes, if it doesn’t stand still.
Tis here.	It’s over here.
Tis here.	There it is.
Tis gone.	It’s gone.
It was about to speak when the cock crew.	It was about to say something when the rooster crowed.
Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue.	Perform the speech just as I taught you, musically and smoothly.
Oh, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb-shows and noise.	I hate it when I hear a blustery actor in a wig tear a passion to shreds, bursting everyone’s eardrums so as to impress the audience on the lower levels of the playhouse, who for the most part can only appreciate loud noises and pantomime shows.
I would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant.	I would whip a guy for making a tyrant sound too tyrannical.
Pray you, avoid it.	Please avoid doing that.
I warrant your honor.	I will, sir.
Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion be your tutor.	But don’t be too tame, either—let your good sense guide you.
I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us, sir.	I hope we’ve corrected that fault pretty well in our company, sir.
O, reform it altogether!	Oh, correct it completely.
And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them, for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too, though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then to be considered.	Make sure that the clowns do not ad-lib, since some of them will make certain dumb audience members laugh mindlessly at them, while an important issue in the play needs to be addressed.
And the queen too, and that presently.	Yes, he will, and the queen as well.
Bid the players make haste.	Tell the actors to hurry.
Will you two help to hasten them?	Will you two help them get ready?
Ay, my lord.	Yes, my lord.
What ho, Horatio!	Well, hello there, Horatio!
Here, sweet lord, at your service.	Here I am at your service, my dear lord.
Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man As e'er my conversation coped withal.	Horatio, you’re the best man I’ve ever known.
O my dear lord—   Nay, do not think I flatter.	Oh, sir— Don’t think I’m flattering you.
For what advancement may I hope from thee That no revenue hast but thy good spirits, To feed and clothe thee?	What could I hope to get from you, who’ve got nothing but your charm to support you in life?
Why should the poor be flattered?	Why would anyone flatter a poor person?
No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp, And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee Where thrift may follow fawning.	No, keep flattery for kissing the hands of those who can pay well.
Dost thou hear?	You understand?
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice And could of men distinguish, her election Hath sealed thee for herself, for thou hast been— As one in suffering all that suffers nothing— A man that Fortune’s buffets and rewards Hast ta'en with equal thanks.	Ever since I’ve been a free agent in my choice of friends, I’ve chosen you because you take everything life hands you with calm acceptance, grateful for both good and bad.
Give him heedful note.	Watch him closely.
They are coming to the play.	They’re coming.
I must be idle.	I can’t talk now.
Get you a place.	Take your seat.
How fares our cousin Hamlet?	So how’s my nephew Hamlet doing?
Excellent, i' faith, of the chameleon’s dish.	Wonderful!
I eat the air, promise-crammed.	I eat the air, like chameleons do.
You cannot feed capons so.	I’m positively stuffed with air, I eat so much of it.
I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet.	I have no idea what you’re talking about, Hamlet.
These words are not mine.	You’re not answering my question.
No, nor mine now.	Mine, neither.
That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.	Indeed I did, my lord.
What did you enact?	What role did you play?
I did enact Julius Caesar.	I played Julius Caesar.
I was killed i' th' Capitol.	I was killed in the Capitol.
Brutus killed me.	Brutus killed me.
Ay, my lord.	Yes, my lord.
They stay upon your patience.	They’re ready whenever you are.
No, good mother.	No thanks, my good mother.
Here’s metal more attractive.	There’s a nicer piece of work right here.
Lady, shall I lie in your lap?	My lady, should I lie in your lap?
No, my lord.	No, my lord.
I mean, my head upon your lap?	I mean, with my head in your lap?
Ay, my lord.	Yes, my lord.
Do you think I meant country matters?	Did you think I was talking about sex?
What is, my lord?	What is, my lord?
Nothing.	Nothing.
You are merry, my lord.	You’re in a good mood tonight, my lord.
Who, I?	Who, me?
Ay, my lord.	Yes, my lord.
O God, your only jig-maker.	Oh God—who is, by the way, the best comic of them all.
What should a man do but be merry?	What can you do but be happy?
For, look you, how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died within these two hours.	Look how cheerful my mother is, only two hours after my father died.
Nay, ’tis twice two months, my lord.	No, my lord, it’s been four months.
So long?	As long as that?
Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I’ll have a suit of sables.	I’ll get myself a fur-trimmed suit.
Then there’s hope a great man’s memory may outlive his life half a year.	In that case, there’s reason to hope a man’s memory may outlive him by six months.
But, by 'r Lady, he must build churches then, or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is “For, oh, for, oh, the hobby-horse is forgot.”      What means this, my lord?	But he’s got to build churches for that to happen, my lady, or else he’ll have to put up with being forgotten, like the hobby-horse in the popular song that goes, “Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, the hobby-horse is forgotten.”   What does this mean, my lord?
Marry, this is miching	This means we’re having some mischievous fun.
Belike this show imports the argument of the play.	This pantomime was probably a summary of the play.
We shall know by this fellow.	This guy will tell us everything.
The players cannot keep counsel.	Actors can’t keep a secret.
They’ll tell all.	They’ll tell all.
Will he tell us what this show meant?	Will he tell us what that pantomime meant?
Ay, or any show that you will show him.	Sure, or anything else you show him.
Be not you ashamed to show, he’ll not shame to tell you what it means.	As long as you aren’t ashamed to show it, he won’t be ashamed to tell you what it means.
You are naught, you are naught.	You’re naughty.
I’ll mark the play.	I’m watching the play.
Is this a prologue or the posy of a ring?	Was that the prologue or the inscription on some wedding ring?
Tis brief, my lord.	It was a bit short, my lord.
As woman’s love.	Yes, as short as a woman’s love.
Madam, how like you this play?	Madam, how are you liking this play?
The lady protests too much, methinks.	The lady’s overdoing it, I think.
Oh, but she’ll keep her word.	Oh, but she’ll keep her word.
Is there no offense in ’t?	Is there anything offensive in it?
No offense i' th' world.	Not offensive at all.
What do you call the play?	What’s the play called?
It faded on the crowing of the cock.	Yes, it faded away when the rooster crowed.
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it, As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?	Don’t you agree that we owe it to him to tell him about this, out of duty and love?
I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see the puppets dallying.	I could even supply the dialogue between you and your lover if you did your little puppet show of love for me.
Come, “The croaking raven doth bellow for revenge—”	We’re all waiting for the revenge!
The story is extant, and writ in choice Italian.	The original story was written in the finest Italian.
You shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of Gonzago’s wife.	You’ll see shortly how the murderer wins the love of Gonzago’s wife.
The king rises.	The king is getting up.
What, frighted with false fire?	What—is he scared of a gun that only fired a blank?
How fares my lord?	My lord, how are you feeling?
Give me some light, away!	Get me out of here!
Lights, lights, lights!	Lights, lights, get us some lights!
A whole one, I.	No, a whole share for me.
Didst perceive?	Did you notice?
Very well, my lord.	Yes, I did, my lord.
Upon the talk of the poisoning?	When the actors were talking about poison?
I did very well note him.	I watched him very closely.
Ah ha!	Ah ha!
Come, some music!	Hey, let’s have some music here!
Come, the recorders!	Play your flutes!
Come, some music!	Come on, music!
Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.	My lord, could I have a word with you?
Sir, a whole history.	You can have a whole story, not just a word.
The king, sir— Ay, sir, what of him?	Sir, the king— Yes, what about him?
Is in his retirement marvelous distempered.	He’s in his chambers now, and he’s extremely upset.
I am tame, sir.	I’ll be good, sir.
Pronounce.	Go ahead.
The queen your mother, in most great affliction of spirit, hath sent me to you.	The queen your mother is upset, and sent me to see you.
You are welcome.	It’s lovely to see you.
Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed.	No, my lord, your polite words are not to the point.
If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do your mother’s commandment.	If you could please stop fooling around, I’ll tell you what your mother wants.
If not, your pardon and my return shall be the end of my business.	If not, I’ll leave you alone and that’ll be the end of my business.
Sir, I cannot.	Sir, I can’t.
What, my lord?	Can’t what, my lord?
Make you a wholesome answer.	Stop fooling around.
My wit’s diseased.	My mind is confused.
Therefore no more but to the matter.	Okay, to the point.
O wonderful son that can so ’stonish a mother!	Oh, what a wonderful son, I can impress my mother!
But is there no sequel at the heels of this mother’s admiration?	But what’s the upshot of her admiration?
Impart.	Do tell.
She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed.	She wants to have a word with you in her bedroom before you go to bed.
We shall obey, were she ten times our mother.	I’d obey even if she were my mother ten times over.
Have you any further trade with us?	Is there anything else I can do for you?
My lord, you once did love me.	My lord, you used to like me.
And do still, by these pickers and stealers.	And still do, I swear by my hands.
Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper?	My lord, what’s wrong with you?
Sir, I lack advancement.	Sir, I have no future ahead of me.
How can that be, when you have the voice of the king himself for your succession in Denmark?	But how can you say that, when the king himself says you’re the heir to the Danish throne?
I do not well understand that.	I don’t really understand what you mean.
Will you play upon this pipe?	Will you play this recorder?
My lord, I cannot.	I can’t, my lord.
I pray you.	Please.
Believe me, I cannot.	I’m serious, I can’t.
I do beseech you.	I’m begging you.
I know no touch of it, my lord.	I have no idea how.
It is as easy as lying.	Oh, it’s as easy as lying.
But these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony.	But I can’t play a melody.
You would seem to know my stops.	I don’t know how.
Sblood, do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe?	My God, do you think I’m easier to manipulate than a pipe?
Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me, yet you cannot play upon me.	You can push my buttons, but you can’t play me for a fool.
God bless you, sir.	Hello and God bless you, sir.
My lord, the queen would speak with you, and presently.	My lord, the queen wants to speak with you right away.
Do you see yonder cloud that’s almost in shape of a camel?	Do you see that cloud up there that looks like a camel?
By th' mass, and ’tis like a camel indeed.	By God, it does look like a camel.
Methinks it is like a weasel.	To me it looks like a weasel.
It is backed like a weasel.	It does have a back like a weasel’s.
Or like a whale.	Or like a whale.
Very like a whale.	Yes, very much like a whale.
Then I will come to my mother by and by.	I’ll go see my mother soon.
I will say so.	I’ll tell her.
Tis now the very witching time of night, When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out Contagion to this world.	This is the time of night when witches come out, when graveyards yawn open and the stench of hell seeps out.
Now could I drink hot blood And do such bitter business as the bitter day Would quake to look on.	I could drink hot blood and do such terrible deeds that people would tremble even in the daylight.
I will speak daggers to her but use none.	I’ll speak as sharp as a dagger to her, but I won’t use one on her.
My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites.	And so, my words and thoughts will be at odds.
I like him not, nor stands it safe with us To let his madness range.	I don’t like the way he’s acting, and it’s not safe for me to let his insanity get out of control.
Therefore prepare you.	So get prepared.
I your commission will forthwith dispatch, And he to England shall along with you.	I’m sending you to England on diplomatic business, and Hamlet will go with you.
The terms of our estate may not endure Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow Out of his lunacies.	As king, I cannot risk the danger he represents as he grows crazier by the hour.
We will ourselves provide.	We’ll take care of it.
The cease of majesty Dies not alone, but, like a gulf, doth draw What’s near it with it.	When a great leader dies he doesn’t die alone but, like a whirlpool, draws others with him.
It is a massy wheel Fixed on the summit of the highest mount, To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things Are mortised and adjoined, which, when it falls, Each small annexment, petty consequence, Attends the boisterous ruin.	He’s like a huge wheel on the top of the highest mountain whose spokes touch the rim of ten thousand smaller things—when it falls down the mountain, every little object goes down with it.
Never alone Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.	Whenever a king sighs, everyone groans.
Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage.	Prepare yourself, please, for this trip.
For we will fetters put upon this fear, Which now goes too free-footed.	We’ll put a leash on this danger that’s now running wild.
We will haste us.	We’ll hurry.
My lord, he’s going to his mother’s closet.	My lord, Hamlet’s going to his mother’s room.
Behind the arras I’ll convey myself To hear the process.	I’ll hide behind the tapestry to hear what they say.
I’ll warrant she’ll tax him home.	I bet she’ll chew him out.
And, as you said (and wisely was it said) 'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother— Since nature makes them partial—should o'erhear The speech, of vantage.	And as you said (and you said it wisely), it’s good to have someone other than a mother listening in on them, since she can be too partial to him.
Fare you well, my liege.	Goodbye, my lord.
I’ll call upon you ere you go to bed And tell you what I know.	I’ll stop by before you go to bed, and tell you what I’ve heard.
Thanks, dear my lord.	Thanks, my dear lord.
It hath the primal eldest curse upon ’t, A brother’s murder.	It has the mark of
So much for him.	So much for Fortinbras.
That cannot be, since I am still possessed Of those effects for which I did the murder: My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.	That won’t work, since I’m still reaping the rewards of that murder: my crown and my queen.
May one be pardoned and retain th' offense?	Can a person be forgiven and still keep the fruits of his crime?
In the corrupted currents of this world Offense’s gilded hand may shove by justice, And oft ’tis seen the wicked prize itself Buys out the law.	In this wicked world, criminals often take the money they stole and use it to buy off the law, shoving justice aside.
But ’tis not so above.	But not in heaven.
What can it not?	What is there left to do?
Yet what can it when one can not repent?	But it can’t help either!
O bosom black as death!	My heart’s as black as death.
O limèd soul that, struggling to be free, Art more engaged!	My soul is stuck to sin, and the more it struggles to break free, the more it sticks.
Help, angels.	Help me, angels!
Make assay.	C’mon, make an effort.
Now might I do it pat.	I could do it easily now.
Now he is a-praying.	He’s praying now.
And now I’ll do ’t.	And now I’ll do it.
And so he goes to heaven.	He’ll come right away.
And so am I revenged.—That would be scanned.	I’ll be right here, silent.
And am I then revenged	Have you forgotten who I am?
No.	No, sit down.
Words without thoughts never to heaven go.	What are you going to do?
He will come straight.	You won’t kill me, will you?
Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.	Repent and avoid damnation.
Speak to her, Hamlet.	Good night to you.
To whom do you speak this?	Who would do that?
Avoid what is to come.	What is it, Laertes?
O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.	What would you like, Laertes?
Good night—but go not to mine uncle’s bed.	Please, let me go.
Assume a virtue if you have it not.	I have to go to England, don’t you know that?
So, again, good night.	What, Gertrude?
I must be cruel only to be kind.	How is Hamlet?
Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.	Oh, this is terrible!
Twere good you let him know, For who that’s but a queen, fair, sober, wise, Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib, Such dear concernings hide?	His wildness is a threat to all of us—to you, to me, to everyone.
Let it work, For ’tis the sport to have the engineer Hoist with his own petard.	I’ve gotten it dirty—ashes to ashes, and dust to dust.
You must translate.	Believe what?
Tis fit we understand them.	Besides, you’re a sponge!
Ah, my good lord, what have I seen tonight!	You think I’m a sponge, my lord?
How does Hamlet?	I’m glad about that.
O heavy deed!	A thing of no importance.
Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answered?	How dangerous to have this madman on the loose!
But, like the owner of a foul disease, To keep it from divulging, let it feed Even on the pith of life.	But a terminal disease requires extreme treatment, or nothing at all.
Where is he gone?	But where is he?
Go seek him out, speak fair, and bring the body Into the chapel.	Bring him to me.
Safely stowed.	At dinner.
What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?	What do you mean by that?
Tell us where ’tis, that we may take it thence And bear it to the chapel.	Where is Polonius?
Believe what?	In heaven.
But such officers do the king best service in the end.	So get ready to leave.
I am glad of it.	Good.
Yet must not we put the strong law on him.	Don’t waste any time.
Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.	I’ll tell him, my lord.
Bring him before us.	Go ahead, then.
Not where he eats, but where he is eaten.	Is he attacking the heartland of Poland or some frontier?
That’s the end.	In the end I grudgingly consented.
What dost you mean by this?	I hereby grant your request, and hope you have a good time.
Therefore prepare thyself.	So why does it seem so particular to you?
The bark is ready and the wind at help, Th' associates tend, and everything is bent For England.	So then the Poles won’t be willing to defend it.
Farewell, dear mother.	Good-bye, sir.
Thy loving father, Hamlet.	Start without me.
My mother.	My God!
Do it, England, For like the hectic in my blood he rages, And thou must cure me.	I have the motivation, the willpower, the ability, and the means to do it.
I will do ’t, my lord.	I won’t speak to her.
Go softly on.	She’s insistent.
They are of Norway, sir.	In fact, she’s crazed.
What says Polonius?	What does she want?
Take thy fair hour, Laertes.	Show her in.
Thou know’st ’tis common.	Please just listen.
Ay, madam, it is common.	Oh, ho!
God be wi' you, sir.	May God be at your table.
Go a little before.	Come, driver!
What is a man If his chief good and market of his time Be but to sleep and feed?	Good night, ladies, good night, sweet ladies, good night, good night.
A beast, no more.	Follow her.
I will not speak with her.	Listen!
What would she have?	What is it?
Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?	Where’s this so-called king?
Nay, but, Ophelia— Pray you, mark.	Please wait.
How do you, pretty lady?	Thank you.
God be at your table.	Let him go, Gertrude.
Conceit upon her father.	Where’s my father?
How long hath she been thus?	He’s dead.
We must be patient, but I cannot choose but weep, to think they should lay him i' th' cold ground.	Don’t mess with me.
Oh, this is the poison of deep grief.	Only my free will—nothing else.
Poor Ophelia Divided from herself and her fair judgment, Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts.	Do you want to know who they are, then?
Alack, what noise is this?	What’s that noise?
I pray you, give me leave.	Please remember, love.
Do not fear our person.	It’s not manly.
Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!	And you’re right to do so.
I dare damnation.	Please, come with me.
Who shall stay you?	Who are the people who want to speak with me?
My will, not all the world.	Sailors, sir.
And for my means, I’ll husband them so well, They shall go far with little.	They say they have letters for you.
Will you know them then?	Show them in.
How now?	Hello, sir.
What noise is that?	God bless you.
Tears seven times salt, Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!	May He bless you, too.
By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight, Till our scale turn the beam.	He will, sir, if He wants to.
You must sing  This nothing’s more than matter.	I have a lot to tell you about them.
There’s rosemary, that’s for remembrance.	Good-bye.
Nay, it is.	It looks that way.
Do you see this, O God?	I didn’t see them.
Laertes, I must commune with your grief, Or you deny me right.	Laertes, I want you to hear what they say.
Let this be so.	What does this mean?
So you shall.	Do you recognize the handwriting?
Seafaring men, sir.	Naked,” he says.
Let them come in.	And in a P.S.
Let him bless thee too.	But let him come.
Fare-well.	That’ll be fine.
Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal, And you must put me in your heart for friend, Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear, That he which hath your noble father slain Pursued my life.	All your talents and gifts didn’t arouse as much envy from him as this one quality did, though to me it’s far from your best attribute.
It well appears.	What quality is that, my lord?
Letters, my lord, from Hamlet.	Yes, from Normandy.
Sailors, my lord, they say.	Yes, that’s the one.
I saw them not.	I know him well.
He received them Of him that brought them.	He’s his homeland’s jewel.
How otherwise?— Will you be ruled by me?	How could you ask?
He is the brooch indeed And gem of all the nation.	That’s the right answer—it shows your love.
Why ask you this?	Let’s go.
And nothing is at a like goodness still.	Damn it!
But, good Laertes, Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.	But wait, what’s that sound?
I will do ’t.	Drowned?
Therefore this project	So she is drowned.
Be as ourself in Denmark.—Madam, come.	Let’s follow him, Gertrude.
Come away.	Let’s follow him.
One woe doth tread upon another’s heel, So fast they follow.—Your sister’s drowned, Laertes.	Here’s the water, right?
Alas, then she is drowned.	Is that how the law sees it?
But yet It is our trick.	It sure is.
Let’s follow, Gertrude.	The coroner’s inquest law.
How much I had to do to calm his rage!	Do you want to know the truth?
Now fear I this will give it start again.	Well there, now you’ve said it.
Therefore let’s follow.	Come on, shovel.
Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she willfully seeks her own salvation?	They keep up Adam’s profession.
The crowner hath sat on her and finds it Christian burial.	What, aren’t you a Christian?
How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defense?	I’ll ask you another question.
It must be  Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver— Give me leave.	If you can’t answer it— Go ahead!
But is this law?	But how?
Ay, marry, is ’t.	Ah, I’ve got it!
Crowner’s quest law.	Go ahead.
Come, my spade.	Now go and get me some booze.
Why, he had none.	Yes, exactly.
Marry, now I can tell.	Indeed, my lord.
Has this fellow no feeling of his business?	Exactly.
He sings at grave- making.	There’s another.
That skull had a tongue in it and could sing once.	Could that be a lawyer’s skull?
It might, my lord.	No more than that, my lord.
Ay, my lord.	Yes, my lord, and calfskin too.
Mine ache to think on ’t.	It’s mine, sir.
Not a jot more, my lord.	For no man, sir.
I will speak to this fellow.—Whose grave’s this, sirrah?	How literal this guy is!
You lie out on ’t, sir, and therefore it is not yours.	You don’t know that?
Tis for the dead, not for the quick.	He’ll recover his sanity there.
Therefore thou liest.	Why not?
What man dost thou dig it for?	What do you mean, “in a strange way”?
What woman, then?	On what grounds?
The age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls his kibe.—How long hast thou been a grave-maker?	How long will a man lie in his grave before he starts to rot?
Of all the days i' the year, I came to ’t that day that our last King Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.	A leathermaker will last nine years.
Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?	Whose was it?
Why, because he was mad.	A crazy bastard.
Why?	Who do you think?
Twill not be seen in him there.	I really don’t know.
How came he mad?	Damn that crazy madman!
How “strangely”?	This one?
Faith, e'en with losing his wits.	Yes, that one.
Why he more than another?	Are you sad about that?
Let me see.	Horatio, tell me something.
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven Visit her face too roughly.—Heaven and earth, Must I remember?	Oh God, do I have to remember that?
Why, she would hang on him As if increase of appetite had grown By what it fed on, and yet, within a month— Let me not think on ’t.	She would hang on to him, and the more she was with him the more she wanted to be with him; she couldn’t get enough of him.
Within a month, Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears Had left the flushing in her gallèd eyes, She married.	Less than a month after my father’s death, even before the tears on her cheeks had dried, she remarried.
It is not nor it cannot come to good, But break, my heart, for I must hold my tongue.	That’s not good, and no good can come of it either.
Hail to your lordship.	Hello, sir.
I am glad to see you well.— Horatio?	Nice to see you again, Horatio—that is your name, right?
Or I do forget myself?	That’s me, sir.
Sir, my good friend, I’ll change that name with you.	I’ll change that name for you.
My good lord.	Hello, sir.
What’s that, my lord?	What’s that, my lord?
Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i' th' earth?	Do you think Alexander the Great looked like this when he was buried?
E'en so.	Exactly like that.
And smelt so?	And smelled like that, too?
Pah!	Whew!
E'en so, my lord.	Just as bad, my lord.
To what base uses we may return, Horatio.	How low we can fall, Horatio.
Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it stopping a bunghole?	Isn’t it possible to imagine that the noble ashes of Alexander the Great could end up plugging a hole in a barrel?
Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.	If you thought that you’d be thinking too much.
No, faith, not a jot.	No, not at all.
Imperious Caesar, dead and turned to clay, Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.	The great emperor Caesar, dead and turned to clay, might plug up a hole to keep the wind away.
Oh, that that earth, which kept the world in awe, Should patch a wall t' expel the winter’s flaw!	Oh, to think that the same body that once ruled the world could now patch up a wall!
But soft, but soft a while.	But quiet, be quiet a minute.
Here comes the king, The queen, the courtiers—who is this they follow, And with such maimèd rites?	Here comes the king, the queen, and the noblemen of court.
This doth betoken The corse they follow did with desperate hand Fordo its own life.	Who are they following?
Couch we a while and mark.	Let’s stay and watch a while.
What ceremony else?	What other rites are you going to give her?
For charitable prayers Shards, flints and pebbles should be thrown on her.	She deserves to have rocks and stones thrown on her body.
Yet here she is allowed her virgin crants, Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home Of bell and burial.	But she has had prayers read for her and is dressed up like a pure virgin, with flowers tossed on her grave and the bell tolling for her.
Must there no more be done?	Isn’t there any other rite you can perform?
No more be done.	No, nothing.
We should profane the service of the dead To sing a requiem and such rest to her As to peace-parted souls.	We would profane the other dead souls here if we sang the same requiem for her that we sang for them.
Lay her i' th' earth, And from her fair and unpolluted flesh May violets spring!	Lay her in the ground, and let violets bloom from her lovely and pure flesh!
I tell thee, churlish priest, A ministering angel shall my sister be When thou liest howling.	I’m telling you, you jerk priest, my sister will be an angel in heaven while you’re howling in hell.
Sweets to the sweet.	Sweet flowers for a sweet girl.
Farewell!	Goodbye!
Oh, treble woe Fall ten times treble on that cursèd head, Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense Deprived thee of!	Oh, damn three times, damn ten times the evil man whose wicked deed deprived you of your ingenious mind.
Hold off the earth awhile Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.	Hold off burying her until I’ve caught her in my arms once more.
Hold off thy hand.	That’s no way to pray.
Pluck them asunder.	Pull them apart.
O my son, what theme?	Oh, my son, what issue is that?
I loved Ophelia.	I loved Ophelia.
Forty thousand brothers Could not with all their quantity of love Make up my sum.	Forty thousand brothers, if you added all their love together, couldn’t match mine.
What wilt thou do for her?	What are you going to do for her?
O, he is mad, Laertes.	Oh, he’s crazy, Laertes!
For love of God, forbear him.	For the love of God, be patient with him.
Swounds, show me what thou'lt do.	Damn it, show me what you’re going to do for her.
Woo’t weep?	Will you cry?
Woo’t fight?	Fight?
Woo’t fast?	Stop eating?
Woo’t tear thyself?	Cut yourself?
I’ll do ’t.	I’ll do all that.
And if thou prate of mountains let them throw Millions of acres on us, till our ground, Singeing his pate against the burning zone, Make Ossa like a wart!	And if you rattle on about mountains, then let them throw millions of acres over us.
This is mere madness.	This is pure insanity.
And thus a while the fit will work on him.	He’ll be like this for a little while.
Anon, as patient as the female dove When that her golden couplets are disclosed, His silence will sit drooping.	Then he’ll be as calm and quiet as a dove waiting for her eggs to hatch.
I loved you ever.	I always loved you.
But it is no matter.	But it doesn’t matter.
I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.	Please, Horatio, go with him.
Who’s there?	Who’s there?
Long live the king!	No, who are  Long live the king!
Barnardo?	Is that Barnardo?
He.	Yes, it’s me.
You come most carefully upon your hour.	You’ve come right on time.
Tis now struck twelve.	The clock’s just striking twelve.
Get thee to bed, Francisco.	Go home to bed, Francisco.
For this relief much thanks.	Thanks for letting me go.
Tis bitter cold, And I am sick at heart.	It’s bitterly cold out, and I’m depressed.
Have you had quiet guard?	Has it been a quiet night?
Not a mouse stirring.	I haven’t even heard a mouse squeak.
Well, good night.	Well, good night.
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus, The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.	If you happen to see Horatio and Marcellus, who are supposed to stand guard with me tonight, tell them to hurry.
I think I hear them.—Stand, ho!	I think I hear them.
So much for this, sir.	That’s enough about that.
Now shall you see the other.	Now I’ll tell you the other story about my journey.
You do remember all the circumstance?	Do you remember the circumstances?
Remember it, my lord?	How could I forget, my lord!
Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting That would not let me sleep.	There was a kind of war in my brain that wouldn’t let me sleep.
Methought I lay Worse than the mutines in the bilboes.	It was worse than being a captive in chains.
Is ’t possible?	Is it possible?
I beseech you.	Yes, please tell me.
Wilt thou know Th' effect of what I wrote?	Do you want to know what I wrote?
Ay, good my lord.	Yes, my lord.
I had my father’s signet in my purse, Which was the model of that Danish seal.	I had my father’s signet ring in my pocket, with the royal seal of Denmark on it.
Folded the writ up in form of th' other, Subscribed it, gave ’t th' impression, placed it safely, The changeling never known.	I folded up the new document, signed it, sealed it, and put it safely back so that no one noticed any difference.
Now, the next day Was our sea fight, and what to this was sequent Thou know’st already.	The next day we had our fight at sea, and you know what happened after that.
So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to ’t.	So Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are in for it.
Why, man, they did make love to this employment.	Man, they were asking for it.
They are not near my conscience.	I don’t feel guilty about them at all.
Their defeat Does by their own insinuation grow.	They got what they deserved.
Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes Between the pass and fell incensèd points Of mighty opposites.	It’s always dangerous when little people get caught in the crossfire of mighty opponents.
Why, what a king is this!	What a king Claudius is!
is ’t not perfect conscience To quit him with this arm?	Isn’t it completely moral to kill him now with this sword—and an easy conscience?
And is ’t not to be damned To let this canker of our nature come In further evil?	And wouldn’t I be damned if I let this monster live to do more harm?
It must be shortly known to him from England What is the issue of the business there.	He’ll find out soon what happened in England.
It will be short.	Soon enough.
The interim’s mine.	But I have the meantime.
I’ll court his favors.	I’ll be nice to him.
But sure the bravery of his grief did put me Into a towering passion.	It was just that the showiness of his grief sent me into a fury.
Peace.—Who comes here?	Hang on a minute—who are you?
Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.	Welcome back to Denmark, my lord.
I humbly thank you, sir.	Thank you kindly, sir.
Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart a thing to you from His Majesty.	My lord, if you have a free moment, I have a message from His Majesty.
I thank your lordship.	No thank you, my lord.
It is very hot.	It’s very hot.
It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.	It is rather cold, indeed, my lord.
But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.	And yet I feel it’s very hot and humid, which is bad for my complexion.
Exceedingly, my lord.	Yes indeed it is, sir.
It is very sultry—as ’twere—I cannot tell how.	Very humid, I can’t tell you how humid it is.
My lord, his majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head.	My lord, His Majesty wanted me to tell you that he’s placed a large bet on you.
Sir, this is the matter—  I beseech you, remember— Nay, good my lord, for mine ease, in good faith.	This is what it’s all about— Please, I beg you— No, my lord, I’m comfortable like this, thank you.
Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you, though I know to divide him inventorially would dizzy th' arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail.	Sir, your description of him doesn’t detract from his good qualities, though I know that trying to list them all would make your head spin, and even so you wouldn’t be able to keep up with him.
A truant disposition, good my lord.	I felt like skipping school, sir.
I would not hear your enemy say so, Nor shall you do mine ear that violence, To make it truster of your own report Against yourself.	I wouldn’t allow your enemies to say that, and I won’t believe it from you.
I know you are no truant.	I know you’d never skip school.
But what is your affair in Elsinore?	What are you doing here in Elsinore?
We’ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.	I’ll teach you to drink hard by the time you leave.
My lord, I came to see your father’s funeral.	Sir, we came to see your father’s funeral.
I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow student.	Please, don’t make fun of me.
I think it was to see my mother’s wedding.	I think you came to see my mother’s wedding instead.
Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.	Well, sir, it’s true it came soon after.
The funeral baked meats Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.	The leftovers from the funeral dinner made a convenient wedding banquet.
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio.	Oh, I’d rather have met my fiercest enemy in heaven, Horatio, than have lived through that terrible day!
My father—methinks I see my father.	My father—I think I see my father.
Where, my lord?	Where, sir?
In my mind’s eye, Horatio.	In my imagination, Horatio.
I saw him once.	I saw him once.
He was a goodly king.	He was an admirable king.
He was a man.	He was a great human being.
Take him for all in all.	He was perfect in everything.
I shall not look upon his like again.	I’ll never see the likes of him again.
Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.	You speak absolutely correctly, sir.
The concernancy, sir?	And what’s the point, sir?
Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath?	Why are we talking about him like this?
Sir?	Sorry, sir?
I know you are not ignorant— I would you did, sir.	I know you know something— Thanks for the compliment, I’m happy you know that.
Yet in faith, if you did, it would not much approve me.	But in fact it doesn’t say much.
Well, sir?	I’m sorry, you were saying?
You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is—	I know you know something about how excellent Laertes is—
I dare not confess that lest I should compare with him in excellence, but to know a man well were to know himself.	I can’t admit that, since you’d have to compare his excellence to mine.
I mean, sir, for his weapon.	Excellent in fencing, I mean, sir.
Rapier and dagger.	The rapier and the dagger.
That’s two of his weapons.	Those are only two of his weapons.
But well.	But, go on.
The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary horses, against the which he has impawned, as I take it, six French rapiers and poniards with their assigns—as girdle, hangers, and so.	The king has bet six Barbary horses, and he has prepared six French rapiers and daggers with all their accessories.
Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of very liberal conceit.	Three of the carriages are very imaginatively designed, and they match the fencing accessories.
What call you the carriages?	What do you mean by “carriages”?
The carriages, sir, are the hangers.	The carriages, sir, are the hangers—where the swords hang.
The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could carry cannon by our sides.	Carriage” makes it sound like it’s pulling around a cannon.
I would it might be hangers till then.	I prefer to call it a “hanger.” But anyway.
But, on: six Barbary horses against six French swords, their assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages—that’s the French bet against the Danish.	Six Barbary horses, six French swords with accessories, and three imaginatively designed carriages—sounds like a French bet against the Danish.
Why is this “impawned,” as you call it?	Why has all this been put on the table?
The king, sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits.	The king, sir, has bet that in a dozen rounds between you and Laertes, he won’t beat you by more than three hits.
How if I answer “No”?	But what if my answer’s no?
If it please His Majesty, ’tis the breathing time of day with me.	It’s my exercise time.
I commend my duty to your lordship.	My services are at your command.
Yours, yours.	Thank you.
He does well to commend it himself.	It’s a good thing he’s here to recommend himself.
There are no tongues else for ’s turn.	No one else would.
He did comply, sir, with his dug before he sucked it.	He used to praise his mother’s nipple before he sucked it.
He sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.	The king wishes to know if you want to play against him right away, or wait awhile.
I am constant to my purpose.	I’ll do whatever the king wants.
They follow the king’s pleasure.	If he’s ready now, so am I.
If his fitness speaks, mine is ready, now or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.	Otherwise, I’ll do it anytime, as long as I’m able.
The king and queen and all are coming down.	The king and queen are coming down with everyone else.
In happy time.	Right on cue.
The queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.	The queen wants you to chat with Laertes—politely—before you begin your match.
She well instructs me.	She’s full of good advice.
You will lose this wager, my lord.	You’re going to lose this bet, my lord.
I do not think so.	I don’t think so.
Since he went into France, I have been in continual practice.	I’ve been practicing fencing constantly since he went off to France.
I shall win at the odds.	With the handicap they’ve given me, I think I’ll win.
But thou wouldst not think how ill all’s here about my heart.	But I have a sinking feeling anyway.
But it is no matter.	Oh well.
I will forestall their repair hither and say you are not fit.	I’ll say you’re not feeling well.
Not a whit.	You’ll do no such thing.
We defy augury.	I thumb my nose at superstitions.
If it be not to come, it will be now.	What’s important is to be prepared.
Since no man of aught he leaves knows, what is ’t to leave betimes?	Since nobody knows anything about what he leaves behind, then what does it mean to leave early?
Let be.	Let it be.
Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.	Come shake hands with Laertes, Hamlet.
But in my terms of honor I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement Till by some elder masters, of known honor, I have a voice and precedent of peace To keep my name ungored.	I will accept no apology until experts in matters of honor show me how to make peace with you without staining my own reputation in doing so.
Come, one for me.	Yes, hand me one too.
I’ll be your foil, Laertes.	I’m going to make you look sharp, Laertes.
You mock me, sir.	You’re making fun of me.
No, by this hand.	No, I swear I’m not.
Very well, my lord.	Yes, my lord, quite well.
Your grace hath laid the odds o' th' weaker side.	You’ve bet on the weaker fencer.
I have seen you both.	I’ve seen both of you fence.
But since he is better we have therefore odds.	But since Laertes is better, we’ve given him a handicap.
Ay, my good lord.	Yes, my lord.
Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.	Put the goblets of wine on that table.
If Hamlet give the first or second hit Or quit in answer of the third exchange, Let all the battlements their ordnance fire!	If Hamlet makes the first or second hit, or gets back at Laertes by making the third hit, then let my soldiers give him a military salute.
The king shall drink to Hamlet’s better breath, And in the cup an union shall he throw Richer than that which four successive kings In Denmark’s crown have worn.	I’ll drink to Hamlet’s health, and into his goblet I’ll drop a pearl even more costly than those in the crowns of the last four Danish kings.
Give me the cups.	Give me the goblets.
Come on, sir.	Come on, sir.
Come, my lord.	Come on, my lord.
One.	That was one hit.
No.	No, it wasn’t.
Judgment?	Referee!
A hit, a very palpable hit.	It was obviously a hit.
Well, again.	Well, let’s go on.
Stay, give me drink.—Hamlet, this pearl is thine.	Give me a goblet.—Hamlet, this pearl’s yours.
Here’s to thy health.	Here’s to your health.
Give him the cup.	Give him the goblet.
Set it by a while.	Set it down awhile.
Come.	Let’s play.
Another hit.	Another hit.
What say you?	What do you say?
A touch, a touch, I do confess ’t.	You got me, I admit it.
Our son shall win.	My son will win.
He’s fat, and scant of breath.— Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.	He’s flabby and out of breath.—Here, Hamlet, take my handkerchief and wipe your forehead.
The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.	The queen drinks to your good luck and happiness, Hamlet.
Good madam.	Thank you, madam.
Gertrude, do not drink.	Gertrude, don’t drink that.
I will, my lord.	Excuse me.
I pray you, pardon me.	I’ll drink it if I like.
I dare not drink yet, madam.	I’d better not drink now.
By and by.	I’ll drink later.
Come, let me wipe thy face.	Come on, let me wipe your face.
I do not think ’t.	I doubt it.
Come, for the third, Laertes.	Get ready for the third hit, Laertes.
You do but dally.	You’re just playing around.
I pray you, pass with your best violence.	Come on, give me your best shot.
I am afeard you make a wanton of me.	I sense you’re treating me like a child.
Say you so?	You think so?
Come on.	Come on.
Have at you now!	Take this!
Part them!	Separate them.
They are incensed.	They’re overdoing it.
Nay, come, again.	No, come on, one more time.
Look to the queen there, ho!	Take care of the queen!
They bleed on both sides.—How is it, my lord?	Both fencers are bleeding—how do you feel, my lord?
How is ’t, Laertes?	How do you feel, Laertes?
Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.	Like a mouse caught in my own trap, Osric.
How does the queen?	How’s the queen?
She swoons to see them bleed.	She fainted at the sight of them bleeding.
The drink, the drink!	The drink, the drink!
I am poisoned.	I’ve been poisoned.
O villainy!	Oh, what evil!
Ho, let the door be locked.	Lock the door.
Treachery!	We’ve been betrayed!
Seek it out.	Find out who did it!
It is here, Hamlet.	I’m the one, Hamlet.
Hamlet, thou art slain.	Hamlet, you’re dead.
No medicine in the world can do thee good.	No medicine in the world can cure you.
In thee there is not half an hour of life.	You don’t have more than half an hour to live.
The treacherous instrument is in thy hand, Unbated and envenomed.	The treacherous weapon is right in your hand, sharp and dipped in poison.
The foul practice Hath turned itself on me.	The foul plan backfired on me.
Lo, here I lie, Never to rise again.	Here I lie and will never get up again.
Thy mother’s poisoned.	Your mother’s been poisoned.
I can no more.	I can’t speak anymore.
The king, the king’s to blame.	The king, the king’s to blame.
The point envenomed too!—Then, venom, to thy work.	Then get to work, poison!
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.	Sir, I think I saw him last night.
Saw who?	Saw who?
The king my father?!	The king my father?!
Season your admiration for a while With an attent ear, till I may deliver, Upon the witness of these gentlemen, This marvel to you.	Just listen carefully while I tell you the amazing thing I saw, with these gentlemen as witnesses.
For God’s love, let me hear.	For God’s sake, let me hear it.
Two nights together had these gentlemen, Marcellus and Barnardo, on their watch, In the dead waste and middle of the night, Been thus encountered: a figure like your father, Armed at point exactly, cap-à-pie, Appears before them and with solemn march Goes slow and stately by them.	After midnight, for two nights running, these two guards, Marcellus and Barnardo, saw a figure that looked very much like your father, in full armor from head to toe.
Thrice he walked By their oppressed and fear-surprisèd eyes Within his truncheon’s length, whilst they, distilled Almost to jelly with the act of fear, Stand dumb and speak not to him.	It just appeared before them and marched past them with slow dignity three times, a staff’s distance from their amazed eyes, while they turned, quaking with fear and too shocked to speak.
I knew your father.	I knew your father.
But where was this?	But where did this happen?
Treason!	Treason!
Treason!	Treason!
O, yet defend me, friends.	Protect me, my friends.
I am but hurt.	I’ve only been hurt, not killed.
Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damnèd Dane, Drink off this potion.	Here, you goddamn incest-breeding Danish murderer, drink this.
Is thy union here?	Is your little pearl in there?
Follow my mother.	Follow my mother.
He is justly served.	He got what he deserved.
It is a poison tempered by himself.	He mixed that poison himself.
Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.	Please forgive me as I forgive you, Hamlet.
Mine and my father’s death come not upon thee, Nor thine on me.	You’re not responsible for my death and my father’s, and I’m not responsible for yours.
Heaven make thee free of it.	God will free you from blame.
Thou livest.	You’re alive.
Never believe it.	Not for a second.
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.	I’m more like an ancient Roman than a corrupt modern Dane.
Here’s yet some liquor left.	Some of this liquor’s still left in the goblet.
As thou'rt a man, Give me the cup.	Please, give me that goblet, if you love me.
Let go!	Let go of it!
By heaven, I’ll have ’t.	I’ll get it from you, I swear.
O God, Horatio, what a wounded name, Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!	Oh God, Horatio, what a damaged reputation I’m leaving behind me, as no one knows the truth.
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart Absent thee from felicity a while, And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain To tell my story.	If you ever loved me, then please postpone the sweet relief of death awhile, and stay in this harsh world long enough to tell my story.
What warlike noise is this?	What are these warlike noises?
Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland, To th' ambassadors of England gives This warlike volley.	Young Fortinbras, returning in triumph from Poland, is firing his guns to greet the English ambassadors.
O, I die, Horatio.	Oh, I’m dying, Horatio!
The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.	This strong poison’s overpowering me.
I cannot live to hear the news from England.	I will not live to hear the news from England.
But I do prophesy the election lights On Fortinbras.	But I bet Fortinbras will win the election to the Danish crown.
He has my dying voice.	He’s got my vote as I die.
O, O, O, O.	Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Where is this sight?	What do I see here?
What is it ye would see?	What would you like to see?
This quarry cries on havoc.	These corpses suggest mayhem.
O proud death, What feast is toward in thine eternal cell, That thou so many princes at a shot So bloodily hast struck?	Oh, proud Death, what banquet are you preparing that you’ve needed to knock off so many princes at one stroke?
The sight is dismal, And our affairs from England come too late.	This is a horrible sight.
The ears are senseless that should give us hearing, To tell him his commandment is fulfilled, That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.	We meant to tell the king that his orders have been carried out, and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
Had it th' ability of life to thank you.	Who will thank us now?
For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.	As for me, I welcome my good luck with sadness.
Let four captains Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage, For he was likely, had he been put on, To have proved most royally.	Let four captains carry Hamlet like a soldier onto the stage.
And, for his passage, The soldiers' music and the rites of war Speak loudly for him.	Military music and military rites will speak for his heroic qualities.
Take up the bodies.	Pick up the corpses.
My lord, upon the platform where we watch.	On the platform where we stand guard, sir.
Did you not speak to it?	Didn’t you talk to it?
My lord, I did, But answer made it none.	I did, sir, but it didn’t answer me.
Tis very strange.	That’s very strange.
As I do live, my honored lord, ’tis true.	I swear to God it’s true, sir.
And we did think it writ down in our duty To let you know of it.	We thought you ought to know about it.
Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.	Yes, I should know, but it disturbs me.
Hold you the watch tonight?	Are you on duty again tonight?
We do, my lord.	Yes, sir.
Armed, say you?	It was armed, you say?
Armed, my lord.	Armed, sir.
From top to toe?	From head to toe?
My lord, from head to foot.	Yes, from top to bottom, sir.
Then saw you not his face?	So you couldn’t see his face, then?
Oh yes, my lord.	Oh, yes, we could, sir.
He wore his beaver up.	He had his helmet visor up.
Pale or red?	Was he pale or flushed and red-faced?
Nay, very pale.	Very pale, sir.
And fixed his eyes upon you?	Did he stare at you?
Most constantly.	The whole time.
I would I had been there.	I wish I’d been there.
Stayed it long?	Did it stay a long time?
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.	About as long as it would take someone to count slowly to a hundred.
Longer, longer.	No, longer than that.
Not when I saw ’t.	Not the time I saw it.
His beard was grizzled, no?	His beard was gray, right?
It was, as I have seen it in his life, A sable silvered.	It was just like in real life, dark brown with silver whiskers in it.
I will watch tonight.	I’ll stand guard with you tonight.
Perchance 'Twill walk again.	Maybe it’ll come again.
I warrant it will.	I bet it will.
If it assume my noble father’s person, I’ll speak to it, though Hell itself should gape And bid me hold my peace.	If it looks like my good father, I’ll speak to it, even if Hell itself opens up and tells me to be quiet.
I pray you all, If you have hitherto concealed this sight, Let it be tenable in your silence still.	I ask you, if you’ve kept this a secret, keep doing so.
And whatsoever else shall hap tonight, Give it an understanding, but no tongue.	Whatever happens tonight, don’t talk about it.
I will requite your loves.	I’ll return the favor.
So fare you well.	So good-bye for now.
Upon the platform, ’twixt eleven and twelve, I’ll visit you.	I’ll see you on the guards' platform between eleven and twelve tonight.
Our duty to your honor.	We’ll do our duty to you, sir.
Your loves, as mine to you.	Give me your love instead, as I give you mine.
Farewell.	Good-bye.
My father’s spirit in arms.	My father’s ghost—armed!
All is not well.	Something’s wrong.
I doubt some foul play.	I suspect some foul play.
Would the night were come!	I wish the night were here already!
Till then sit still, my soul.	Until then, I have to remain calm.
Foul deeds will rise, Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men’s eyes.	Bad deeds will be revealed, no matter how people try to hide them.
My necessaries are embarked.	My belongings are on the ship already.
Farewell.	Good-bye.
And, sister, as the winds give benefit And convey is assistant, do not sleep, But let me hear from you.	And, my dear sister, as long as the winds are blowing and ships are sailing, let me hear from you—write.
Do you doubt that?	Do you doubt I’ll write?
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favor, Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood, A violet in the youth of primy nature, Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting, The perfume and suppliance of a minute.	As for Hamlet and his attentions to you, just consider it a big flirtation, the temporary phase of a hot-blooded youth.
No more.	It won’t last.
No more but so?	Not a second more.
Think it no more.	No more than a minute?
Then weigh what loss your honor may sustain If with too credent ear you list his songs, Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open To his unmastered importunity.	Then think about how shameful it would be for you to give in to his seductive talk and surrender your treasure chest to his greedy hands.
Fear it, Ophelia.	Watch out, Ophelia.
Fear it, my dear sister, And keep you in the rear of your affection, Out of the shot and danger of desire.	Just keep your love under control, and don’t let yourself become a target of his lust.
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth, Contagious blastments are most imminent.	Baby blooms are most susceptible to disease.
Be wary, then.	So be careful.
Best safety lies in fear.	Fear will keep you safe.
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.	Young people often lose their self-control even without any help from others.
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep As watchman to my heart.	I’ll keep your words of wisdom close to my heart.
O, fear me not.	Don’t worry, I won’t.
I stay too long.	I’ve been here too long.
But here my father comes.	And here comes father.
Yet here, Laertes?	You’re still here?
Aboard, aboard, for shame!	Shame on you—get on board!
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail And you are stayed for.	The wind is filling your ship’s sail, and they’re waiting for you.
There, my blessing with thee.	Here, I give you my blessing again.
And these few precepts in thy memory Look thou character.	And just try to remember a few rules of life.
Give thy thoughts no tongue, Nor any unproportioned thought his act.	Don’t say what you’re thinking, and don’t be too quick to act on what you think.
Be thou familiar but by no means vulgar.	Be friendly to people but don’t overdo it.
Beware Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in, Bear ’t that th' opposèd may beware of thee.	Don’t be quick to pick a fight, but once you’re in one, hold your own.
Give every man thy ear but few thy voice.	Listen to many people, but talk to few.
Take each man’s censure but reserve thy judgment.	Hear everyone’s opinion, but reserve your judgment.
Farewell.	Good-bye, son.
Your servants tend.	Your servants are waiting.
Tis in my memory locked, And you yourself shall keep the key of it.	It’s locked away in my memory, and you’ve got the key.
Farewell.	Good-bye.
What is ’t, Ophelia, he hath said to you?	What did he tell you, Ophelia?
So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.	Something about Hamlet.
If it be so as so ’tis put on me— And that in way of caution—I must tell you, You do not understand yourself so clearly As it behooves my daughter and your honor.	If things are the way people tell me they are—and they’re only telling me this to warn me—then I have to say, you’re not conducting yourself with the self-restraint a daughter of mine should show.
What is between you?	What’s going on between you two?
Give me up the truth.	Tell me the truth.
He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders Of his affection to me.	He’s offered me a lot of affection lately.
Affection!	Affection!” That’s nothing!
Pooh, you speak like a green girl, Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.	You’re talking like some innocent girl who doesn’t understand the ways of the world.
Do you believe his “tenders,” as you call them?	Do you believe his “offers,” as you call them?
I do not know, my lord, what I should think.	I don’t know what to believe, father.
Marry, I’ll teach you.	Then I’ll tell you.
Think yourself a baby That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay, Which are not sterling.	Believe that you are a foolish little baby for believing these “offers” are something real.
Tender yourself more dearly, Or—not to crack the wind of the poor phrase, Running it thus—you’ll tender me a fool.	Offer yourself more respect, or—not to beat this word to death—you’ll offer me the chance to be a laughing-stock.
Go to, go to.	Go on.
And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord, With almost all the holy vows of heaven.	And he’s made the holiest vows to me, to back up what he says.
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks.	These vows are just traps for stupid birds.
I do know, When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul Lends the tongue vows.	I know when a man is on fire, he’ll swear anything.
For Lord Hamlet, Believe so much in him that he is young, And with a larger tether may he walk Than may be given you.	Remember that Hamlet is young and has a lot more freedom to fool around than you do.
Look to ’t, I charge you.	Do as I say.
Come your ways.	Now come along.
I shall obey, my lord.	I’ll do as you say, father.
Friends to this ground.	Friends of this country.
And liegemen to the Dane.	And servants of the Danish king.
Give you good night.	Good night to you both.
O, farewell, honest soldier.	Good-bye.
Who hath relieved you?	Who’s taken over the watch for you?
Barnardo has my place.	Barnardo’s taken my place.
Give you good night.	Good night.
Say what, is Horatio there?	Is Horatio here too?
A piece of him.	More or less.
What, has this thing appeared again tonight?	So, tell us, did you see that thing again tonight?
I have seen nothing.	I haven’t seen anything.
Horatio says ’tis but our fantasy And will not let belief take hold of him Touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us.	Horatio says we’re imagining it, and won’t let himself believe anything about this horrible thing that we’ve seen twice now.
Therefore I have entreated him along With us to watch the minutes of this night, That if again this apparition come He may approve our eyes and speak to it.	That’s why I’ve begged him to come on our shift tonight, so that if the ghost appears he can see what we see and speak to it.
It is a nipping and an eager air.	Yes, it’s definitely nippy.
What hour now?	What time is it?
I think it lacks of twelve.	A little before twelve, I think.
No, it is struck.	No, it’s just after twelve; I heard the clock strike.
Indeed?	Really?
I heard it not.	I didn’t hear it.
It then draws near the season Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.	So it’s nearly the time when the ghost likes to appear.
What does this mean, my lord?	What does that mean, sir?
Is it a custom?	Is that a tradition?
Ay, marry, is ’t.	Yes, it is.
But to my mind, though I am native here And to the manner born, it is a custom More honored in the breach than the observance.	But though I was born here and should consider that tradition part of my own heritage, I think it would be better to ignore it than practice it.
This heavy-headed revel east and west Makes us traduced and taxed of other nations.	Other countries criticize us for our loud partying.
They clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase Soil our addition.	They call us drunks and insult our noble titles.
And indeed it takes From our achievements, though performed at height, The pith and marrow of our attribute.	And our drunkenness does detract from our achievements, as great as they are, and lessens our reputations.
The dram of evil Doth all the noble substance of a doubt To his own scandal.	A tiny spot of evil casts doubt on their good qualities and ruins their reputations.
Look, my lord, it comes!	Look, sir—here it comes!
Angels and ministers of grace defend us!	Oh angels, protect us!
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damned, Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell, Be thy intents wicked or charitable, Thou comest in such a questionable shape That I will speak to thee.	Whether you’re a good spirit or a cursed demon, whether you bring heavenly breezes or blasts of hell fire, whether your intentions are good or evil, you look so strange I want to talk to you.
I’ll call thee “Hamlet,” “King,” “Father,” “royal Dane.” O, answer me!	I’ll call you “Hamlet Senior,” “King,” “Father,” “royal Dane.” Answer me!
Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death, Have burst their cerements; why the sepulcher,	Don’t drive me crazy with curiosity, but tell me why your church-buried bones have burst out of their coffin, and why your tomb,
Wherein we saw thee quietly interred, Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws To cast thee up again.	where we quietly buried you, has opened up its heavy marble jaws to spit you out again.
Wherefore?	Why?
It beckons you to go away with it, As if it some impartment did desire To you alone.	It wants you to go off with it, as if it wants to tell you something alone.
Look, with what courteous action It waves you to a more removèd ground.	Look how politely it’s pointing you to a place that’s farther away.
But do not go with it.	But don’t go.
No, by no means.	Definitely not.
Do not, my lord.	Don’t do it, sir.
Why, what should be the fear?	Why, what’s the danger?
I do not set my life in a pin’s fee, And for my soul—what can it do to that, Being a thing immortal as itself?	And as for my soul, how can the ghost endanger that, since it’s as immortal as the ghost is?
It waves me forth again.	Look, it’s waving me over again.
I’ll follow it.	I’ll follow it.
And there assume some other horrible form, Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason And draw you into madness?	where it takes on some other horrible form that drives you insane.
Think of it.	Think about it.
It waves me still.	It’s still waving to me.
You shall not go, my lord.	You’re not going, sir.
Hold off your hands.	Let go of me.
Be ruled.	Calm down.
You shall not go.	You’re not going anywhere.
Still am I called.—Unhand me, gentlemen.	Let me go, gentlemen.
By heaven, I’ll make a ghost of him that lets me.	I swear, if anyone holds me back, I’ll make a ghost of him!
He waxes desperate with imagination.	His imagination is making him crazy.
Let’s follow.	Let’s follow them.
Tis not fit thus to obey him.	It’s not right to obey his orders to let him go alone.
Nay, let’s follow him.	No, let’s follow him.
Where wilt thou lead me?	Where are you taking me?
Speak, I’ll go no further.	Speak.
Mark me.	Listen to me.
I will.	I will.
My hour is almost come When I to sulfurous and tormenting flames Must render up myself.	The hour has almost come when I have to return to the horrible flames of purgatory.
Alas, poor ghost!	Ah, poor ghost!
Speak.	Speak.
I am bound to hear.	I’m ready to hear you.
So art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear.	You must be ready for revenge, too, when you hear me out.
What?	What?
I am thy father’s spirit, Doomed for a certain term to walk the night And for the day confined to fast in fires, Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature Are burnt and purged away.	I’m the ghost of your father, doomed for a certain period of time to walk the earth at night, while during the day I’m trapped in the fires of purgatory until I’ve done penance for my past sins.
But that I am forbid To tell the secrets of my prison house, I could a tale unfold whose lightest word Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,	If I weren’t forbidden to tell you the secrets of
Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres, Thy knotted and combinèd locks to part And each particular hair to stand on end, Like quills upon the fearful porpentine.	make your eyes jump out of their sockets, and your hair stand on end like porcupine quills.
But this eternal blazon must not be To ears of flesh and blood.	But mortals like you aren’t allowed to hear this description of the afterlife.
List, list, O, list!	Listen, listen!
If thou didst ever thy dear father love— O God!	If you ever loved your poor dear father— Oh God!
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.	Take revenge for his horrible murder, that crime against nature.
Murder?	Murder?
Murder most foul, as in the best it is.	His most horrible murder.
But this most foul, strange and unnatural.	Murder’s always horrible, but this one was especially horrible, weird, and unnatural.
Haste me to know ’t, that I, with wings as swift As meditation or the thoughts of love, May sweep to my revenge.	You’d have to be as lazy as a weed on the shores of  I knew it!
My uncle?	My uncle?
O Hamlet, what a falling off was there!	Oh, Hamlet, how far she fell!
From me, whose love was of that dignity That it went hand in hand even with the vow I made to her in marriage, and to decline Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor To those of mine.	She went from me, who loved her with the dignity and devotion that suits a legitimate marriage, to a wretch whose natural gifts were poor compared to mine.
Brief let me be.	So let me be brief here.
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother’s hand Of life, of crown, of queen at once dispatched, Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,	And that’s how my brother robbed me of my life, my crown, and my queen all at once.
Oh, horrible, oh, horrible, most horrible!	Oh, it’s horrible, horrible, so horrible!
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.	If you are human, don’t stand for it.
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be A couch for luxury and damnèd incest.	Don’t let the Danish king’s bed be a nest of incest.
Leave her to heaven And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge To prick and sting her.	Leave her to God and her own guilt.
Fare thee well at once.	Now, good-bye.
The glowworm shows the matin to be near, And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire.	The glowworm’s light is beginning to fade, so morning is near.
Adieu, adieu, adieu.	Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye.
Remember me.	Remember me.
O all you host of heaven!	Ah, all you up in heaven!
O earth!	And earth!
What else?	What else?
And shall I couple hell?	Shall I include hell as well?
Oh, fie!	Damn it!
Hold, hold, my heart, And you, my sinews, grow not instant old, But bear me stiffly up.	Keep beating, my heart, and muscles, don’t grow old yet—keep me standing.
Remember thee!	Remember you!
Ay, thou poor ghost, whiles memory holds a seat In this distracted globe.	Yes, you poor ghost, as long as I have any power of memory in this distracted head.
Remember thee!	Remember you!
Yea, from the table of my memory I’ll wipe away all trivial fond records, All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past That youth and observation copied there, And thy commandment all alone shall live Within the book and volume of my brain, Unmixed with baser matter.	Yes, I’ll wipe my mind clean of all trivial facts and memories and preserve only your commandment there.
Yes, by heaven!	Yes, by God!
O most pernicious woman!	Oh, you evil woman!
O villain, villain, smiling, damnèd villain!	Oh, you villain, villain, you damned, smiling villain!
My tables!—Meet it is I set it down That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain.	Where’s my notebook?—It’s a good idea for me to write down that one can smile and smile, and be a villain.
At least I’m sure it may be so in Denmark.	At least it’s possible in Denmark.
Remember me.” I have sworn ’t.	He said, “Remember me.” I swore I would.
My lord, my lord!	Sir, sir!
Lord Hamlet— Heaven secure him!	Lord Hamlet.— Please let him be all right!
So be it.	I’m all right.
Illo, ho, ho, my lord!	Oh-ho-ho, sir!
Hillo, ho, ho, boy.	Oh-ho-ho, kid!
Come, bird, come.	Come here.
How is ’t, my noble lord?	So how did it go, sir?
What news, my lord?	What happened, sir?
Oh, wonderful!	It was incredible!
Good my lord, tell it.	Oh, please, tell us, sir.
Not I, my lord, by heaven.	I swear I won’t, sir.
Nor I, my lord.	I won’t either, sir.
How say you, then?	Okay.
But you’ll be secret?	But you promise you can keep a secret?
Ay, by heaven, my lord.	Yes, I swear.
Sit down a while And let us once again assail your ears, That are so fortified against our story, What we have two nights seen.	Sit down for a while, and we’ll tell you again the story you don’t want to believe, about what we’ve seen two nights now.
Well, sit we down, And let us hear Barnardo speak of this.	Well, let’s sit down and listen to Barnardo tell us.
Last night of all, When yond same star that’s westward from the pole Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself, The bell then beating one— Peace, break thee off.	Last night, when that star to the west of the North Star had traveled across the night sky to that point where it’s shining now, at one o'clock, Marcellus and I— Quiet, shut up!
Look where it comes again!	It’s come again.
In the same figure like the king that’s dead.	Looking just like the dead king.
Most like.	Very much so.
It harrows me with fear and wonder.	It’s terrifying.
It would be spoke to.	It wants us to speak to it.
Question it, Horatio.	Ask it something, Horatio.
By heaven, I charge thee, speak.	By God, I order you to speak.
There’s ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark But he’s an arrant knave.	Any villain in Denmark is going to be, well, a villain.
There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave To tell us this.	You don’t need a ghost returning from the grave to tell you that, sir.
Why, right, you are in the right.	Yes, you’re absolutely right.
And so, without more circumstance at all, I hold it fit that we shake hands and part.	So, without further ado, the best thing to do now is probably just to shake hands and go our separate ways.
You, as your business and desire shall point you— For every man has business and desire, Such as it is—and for my own poor part, Look you, I’ll go pray.	You go and take care of your business (since everybody has some business to take care of, whatever it is worth), and I’ll go and pray.
These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.	You’re talking in such a crazy way, sir.
There’s no offense, my lord.	No offense taken.
Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio, And much offense too.	Ah, but there is, Horatio, there’s a lot of offense.
Touching this vision here, It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.	As for this ghost we just saw, he’s a real one, I can tell you that much.
For your desire to know what is between us, O'ermaster ’t as you may.	But regarding what happened between us, don’t ask—I can’t tell you.
And now, good friends, As you are friends, scholars and soldiers, Give me one poor request.	And now, my friends, my courageous and educated friends, do me one small favor.
What is ’t, my lord?	What is it, sir?
We will.	Of course we will.
Never make known what you have seen tonight.	Don’t ever tell anyone what you’ve seen tonight.
My lord, we will not.	We won’t, sir.
Nay, but swear ’t.	No, you have to swear it.
In faith, my lord, not I.	I swear to God I won’t.
Nor I, my lord, in faith.	Me too, I won’t, I swear to God.
Upon my sword.	Swear by my sword.
We have sworn, my lord, already.	But we already swore, sir.
Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.	Yes, but swear by my sword this time.
Consent to swear.	Agree to swear.
Never to speak of this that you have seen.	You swear never to mention what you’ve seen.
Swear by my sword.	Swear by my sword.
Come hither, gentlemen, And lay your hands again upon my sword.	Come over here, gentlemen, and put your hands on my sword again.
Swear by my sword Never to speak of this that you have heard.	Swear by my sword you’ll never mention what you’ve heard.
Well said, old mole!	You said it right, old mole.
A worthy pioneer!	What a tunneler!
Once more remove, good friends.	Let’s move again, my friends.
O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!	My God, this is unbelievably strange.
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.	Then give it a nice welcome, as you would give to any stranger.
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.	There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than you’ve even dreamed of.
This not to do, So grace and mercy at your most need help you, Swear.	Swear you won’t.
Nay, come, let’s go together.	Let’s go back to court together, but
Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.	Give him this money and these letters, Reynaldo.
I will, my lord.	I will, sir.
You shall do marvelous wisely, good Reynaldo, Before you visit him, to make inquire Of his behavior.	It would be wonderfully wise of you, my dear Reynaldo, to ask around about his behavior a little before you visit him.
My lord, I did intend it.	That’s what I thought too, sir.
Marry, well said, very well said.	Excellent, very good.
Take you, as ’twere, some distant knowledge of him, As thus: “I know his father and his friends, And, in part, him.” Do you mark this, Reynaldo?	Do you get what I’m saying, Reynaldo?
Ay, very well, my lord.	Yes, very well, sir.
And in part him, but,” you may say, “not well.	You should say, “I sort of know him, but not well.
Addicted so and so.—” And there put on him What forgeries you please.	Isn’t he the one who’s always,” and so on.
But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips	Like gambling, sir?
Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, Quarreling, drabbing—you may go so far.	That’s right, or drinking, swearing, fist-fighting, visiting prostitutes—that kind of thing.
My lord, that would dishonor him!	But that would ruin his reputation!
Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.	Oh no, not if you say it right.
But, my good lord— Wherefore should you do this?	But, sir— Why should you do this, you want to know?
Ay, my lord.	Yes, sir.
I would know that.	I’d like to know.
Very good, my lord.	Yes, sir.
And then, sir, does he this, he does— What was I about to say?	And then he’ll … he’ll … wait, what was I about to say?
By the mass, I was about to say something.	Good God, I was about to say something.
Where did I leave?	What was I saying?
I saw him yesterday”—or “t' other day,” Or then, or then, with such or such—“and, as you say, There was he gaming, there o'ertook in’s rouse, There falling out at tennis,” or, perchance, “I saw him enter such a house of sale”—   Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth.	I just saw him yesterday,” or “the other day,” or whenever it is, you know, “and there he was gambling,” or “there he was, totally wasted, or fighting with somebody about a tennis match, or going into a house of ill repute”—that means a whorehouse, you know—or whatever.
You have me, have you not?	You get my point, don’t you?
My lord, I have.	Yes, I do, sir.
God be wi' you.	God bless you.
Fare you well.	Have a safe trip.
Good my lord.	Thank you, sir.
I shall, my lord.	I will, sir.
And let him ply his music.	And I hope he’s studying his music like he’s supposed to.
Well, my lord.	Got it, sir.
Farewell.	Good-bye.
With what, i' th' name of God?	From what, in God’s name?
Mad for thy love?	Is he crazy with love for you?
What said he?	What did he say?
Long stayed he so.	He stayed like that a long time.
At last, a little shaking of mine arm And thrice his head thus waving up and down, He raised a sigh so piteous and profound As it did seem to shatter all his bulk And end his being.	Finally, after shaking my arm a little, and jerking his head up and down three times, he sighed like it was his last breath.
Come, go with me.	Come with me.
I will go seek the king.	I’ll go tell the king about this.
This is the very ecstasy of love, Whose violent property fordoes itself And leads the will to desperate undertakings As oft as any passion under heaven That does afflict our natures.	Love is such a violent emotion that it makes people self-destruct, as much as any strong emotion.
I am sorry.	I’m so sorry.
That hath made him mad.	That’s what made him crazy.
I am sorry that with better heed and judgment I had not quoted him.	I regret not observing him more closely before I told you to do that.
I feared he did but trifle And meant to wreck thee.	I thought he was just toying with you and meant to ruin your reputation.
But beshrew my jealousy!	Damn my suspicious thoughts!
By heaven, it is as proper to our age To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions As it is common for the younger sort To lack discretion.	It’s as common for us old people to assume we know more than we do as for young people to be too wild and crazy.
Come, go we to the king.	Come on, let’s go see the king.
Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.	Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
Moreover that we much did long to see you, The need we have to use you did provoke Our hasty sending.	I’ve wanted to see you for a long time now, but I sent for you so hastily because I need your help right away.
Something have you heard Of Hamlet’s “transformation”—so call it Since nor th' exterior nor the inward man Resembles that it was.	You’ve probably heard about the “change” that’s come over Hamlet—that’s the only word for it, since inside and out he’s different from what he was before.
What it should be, More than his father’s death, that thus hath put him So much from th' understanding of himself, I cannot dream of.	I can’t imagine what’s made him so unlike himself, other than his father’s death.
Both your majesties Might, by the sovereign power you have of us, Put your dread pleasures more into command Than to entreaty.	Both you and the king might have ordered us to execute your command, instead of asking us so politely.
But we both obey And here give up ourselves, in the full bent, To lay our service freely at your feet To be commanded.	But we’ll obey.
Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.	Thanks, Rosencrantz and worthy Guildenstern.
Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.	Thanks, Guildenstern and worthy Rosencrantz.
And I beseech you instantly to visit My too much changèd son.	I beg you to pay a visit right away to my son, who’s changed too much.
Go, some of you, And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.	Servants, take these gentlemen to see Hamlet.
Heavens make our presence and our practices Pleasant and helpful to him!	I hope to God we can make him happy and do him some good!
Ay, amen!	Amen to that!
Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord, Are joyfully returned.	The ambassadors are back from Norway, sir.
Thou still hast been the father of good news.	Once again you bring good news.
Have I, my lord?	Do I, sir?
I assure my good liege, I hold my duty as I hold my soul, Both to my God and to my gracious king.	I assure your majesty I’m only doing my duty both to my God and my good king.
It is offended.	It looks like you’ve offended it.
See, it stalks away.	Look, it’s going away.
Stay!	Stay!
I charge thee, speak!	I order you, speak!
How now, Horatio?	What’s going on, Horatio?
You tremble and look pale.	You’re pale and trembling.
Is not this something more than fantasy?	You agree now that we’re not imagining this, don’t you?
What think you on ’t?	What do you think about it?
Before my God, I might not this believe Without the sensible and true avouch Of mine own eyes.	I swear to God, if I hadn’t seen this with my own eyes I’d never believe it.
Is it not like the king?	Doesn’t it look like the king?
As thou art to thyself.	Yes, as much as you look like yourself.
Such was the very armour he had on When he the ambitious Norway combated.	The king was wearing exactly this armor when he fought the king of Norway.
So frowned he once when, in an angry parle, He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.	And the ghost frowned just like the king did once when he attacked the Poles, traveling on the ice in sleds.
Tis strange.	It’s weird.
And I do think—or else this brain of mine Hunts not the trail of policy so sure As it hath used to do—that I have found The very cause of Hamlet’s lunacy.	And I believe—unless this brain of mine is not so politically cunning as it used to be—that I’ve found out why Hamlet’s gone crazy.
Oh, speak of that.	Tell me!
That do I long to hear.	I want very much to find out.
Give first admittance to th' ambassadors.	All right, but first let the ambassadors speak.
My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.	Then you can hear my news, as dessert.
Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.	Then be so kind as to show them in.
He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found The head and source of all your son’s distemper.	Gertrude, he says he’s found out the reason for your son’s insanity.
I doubt it is no other but the main: His father’s death and our o'erhasty marriage.	I doubt it’s anything but the obvious reason: his father’s dying and our quick marriage.
Well, we shall sift him.—Welcome, my good friends!	Welcome, my good friends.
Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?	Tell me, Voltemand, what’s the news from the king of Norway?
Whereat grieved— That so his sickness, age, and impotence Was falsely borne in hand—sends out arrests On Fortinbras, which he, in brief, obeys, Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine Makes vow before his uncle never more To give th' assay of arms against your majesty.	He was very upset that Fortinbras had taken advantage of his being old and sick to deceive him, and he ordered Fortinbras’s arrest.
Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,	Fortinbras swore never to threaten Denmark again.
Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee And his commission to employ those soldiers, So levied as before, against the Polack, With an entreaty, herein further shown, That it might please you to give quiet pass Through your dominions for this enterprise, On such regards of safety and allowance As therein are set down.	The old king was so overjoyed by this promise that he gave young Fortinbras an annual income of three thousand  I like this news, and when I have time I’ll read this and think about how to reply.
Meantime we thank you for your well-took labor.	Meanwhile, thank you for your efforts.
Go to your rest.	Go relax now.
At night we’ll feast together.	Tonight we’ll have dinner.
Most welcome home!	Welcome back!
This business is well ended.	Well, that turned out well in the end.
My liege and madam, to expostulate What majesty should be, what duty is, Why day is day, night night, and time is time, Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.	Sir and madam, to make grand speeches about what majesty is, what service is, or why day is day, night is night, and time is time is just a waste of a lot of day, night, and time.
Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes, I will be brief: your noble son is mad.	Your son is crazy.
Mad call I it, for, to define true madness, What is ’t but to be nothing else but mad?	Crazy” I’m calling it, since how can you say what craziness is except to say that it’s craziness?
But let that go.	But that’s another story.
Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.	Think about it.
I have a daughter—have while she is mine— Who in her duty and obedience, mark, Hath given me this.	I have a daughter (I have her until she gets married) who’s given me this letter, considering it her duty.
Good madam, stay a while.	Madam, please be patient.
I will be faithful.	I’ll read it to you.
O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers.	Oh, Ophelia, I’m bad at poetry.
I have not art to reckon my groans, but that I love thee best, oh, most best, believe it.	I can’t put my feelings into verse, but please believe I love you best, oh, best of all.
Adieu.	Believe it.
Hamlet.” This in obedience hath my daughter shown me, And more above, hath his solicitings, As they fell out by time, by means, and place, All given to mine ear.	Hamlet.” Dutifully and obediently my daughter showed me this letter, and more like it.
But how hath she received his love?	And how did she react to all this?
What do you think of me?	Sir, what is your opinion of me?
As of a man faithful and honorable.	I know you are loyal and honorable.
I would fain prove so.	I would like to prove to you that I am.
What might you think?	No, I had to do something.
No, I went round to work, And my young mistress thus I did bespeak: “Lord Hamlet is a prince out of thy star.	And so I said to my daughter: “Lord Hamlet is a prince, he’s out of your league.
It may be, very like.	It may be, it certainly may be.
Hath there been such a time—I would fain know that— That I have positively said, “'Tis so,” When it proved otherwise?	Has there ever been a time—I’d really like to know—when I’ve definitely said something was true, and it turned out not to be true?

Away, I do beseech you, both away.	Please go away, both of you.
I’ll board him presently.	I’ll speak to him now.

Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy, And will not let belief take hold of him Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.	Horatio says it’s all in our imagination, And doesn’t believe a word we say About this dreaded sight, seen twice by us.
Therefore I have entreated him along With us to watch the minutes of this night, That if again this apparition come He may approve our eyes and speak to it.	So I’ve begged him to come along With us to watch what happens this night, That, if this apparition comes again, He may believe what we have seen and speak to it.
Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.	Nonsense, nonsense, it will not appear.
Sit down awhile, And let us once again assail your ears, That are so fortified against our story, What we two nights have seen.	Sit down awhile, And let us tell you once again, You who is so stubborn in not believing our story, What we have seen these last two nights.
Well, sit we down, And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.	OK, let’s sit down, And listen to Bernardo speak of this.

Last night, When that star up there, that's west of the North Pole, Had moved around to light that part of the sky Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself, The clock’s bell then tolling one, Quiet, stop!

I think it be no other but e'en so.	I think it can be no other reason but that.

In the most high and palmy state of Rome, A little ere the mightiest Julius fell, The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood, Disasters in the sun; and the moist star, Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.	In the most high and palm tree-like state of Rome, A little before the mightiest Julius Caesar was killed, The graves had no bodies, and the dead in sheets Squeaked and gibbered in the Roman streets, And stars with trains of fire and red morning dews, Disasters in the sun.

It was about to speak, when the cock crew.	It was about to speak, when the rooster crowed.
And then it started, like a guilty thing Upon a fearful summons.	And then it seemed startled, like a guilty thing Running from a court order.
I have heard The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat Awake the god of day, and at his warning, Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air, The extravagant and erring spirit hies To his confine; and of the truth herein This present object made probation.	I have heard The rooster, that is the trumpet of the morning, With his lofty and shrill-sounding throat, Awakes the god of day, and, at his warning, Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air, The straying and wandering spirit hurries back To his grave.

So have I heard and do in part believe it.	I’ve heard that too, and partly believe it.

Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras, Holding a weak supposal of our worth, Or thinking by our late dear brother's death Our state to be disjoint and out of frame, Colleagued with this dream of his advantage, He hath not fail'd to pester us with message, Importing the surrender of those lands Lost by his father, with all bonds of law, To our most valiant brother.	I will tell you now, as you know, young Fortinbras, Not thinking very much of us, Or thinking that our late dear brother's death Made our country disorganized and no longer powerful, Conspiring with this dream of his advantage, Has not failed to pester us with messages, Asking us to the surrender of those lands Lost by his father, within all the rules of law, To our most valiant brother.

So, oft it chances in particular men, That for some vicious mole of nature in them, As in their birth—wherein they are not guilty, Since nature cannot choose his origin— By the o'ergrowth of some complexion, Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason, Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens The form of plausive manners, that these men— Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect, Being nature's livery, or fortune's star— Their virtues else—be they as pure as grace, As infinite as man may undergo— Shall in the general censure take corruption From that particular fault.

Suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure.

And if the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating idiot, does that mean, you think, that we should also be an ass and a fool and a prating idiot?
I will speak lower.	Think about it.
I pray you and beseech you that you will.	I will lower my voice.
Though it appear a little out of fashion, There is much care and valor in this Welshman.	Though he seems a little old-fashioned, there is much care and courage in this Welshman.
Brother John Bates, is not that the morning which breaks yonder?	Brother John Bates, isn’t that dawn breaking over there?
We see yonder the beginning of the day, but I think we shall never see the end of it.—Who goes there?	That’s the beginning of the day we see, but I don’t think we’ll see the end of it.—Who goes there?
A friend.	A friend.
Under what captain serve you?	What captain do you serve?
Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.	Sir Thomas Erpingham.
A good old commander and a most kind gentleman.	A veteran commander and a very kind gentleman.
I pray you, what thinks he of our estate?	Tell me, what does he think of our situation?
Even as men wracked upon a sand, that look to be washed off the next tide.	We’re men beached on the sand, hoping to be washed out by the next tide.
He hath not told his thought to the king?	He hasn’t told this to the king, has he?
The violet smells to him as it doth to me.	The violet smells to him the same as it does to me.
His ceremonies laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man, and though his affections are higher mounted than ours, yet when they stoop, they stoop with the like wing.	And though his feelings may be pitched higher than ours, when they plummet, they plummet that much farther.
Therefore, when he sees reason of fears as we do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish as ours are.	Therefore, when he has reason to fear, as we do, his fears are without question of the same order.
Yet, in reason, no man should possess him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing it, should dishearten his army.	Still, it stands to reason that he mustn’t betray his fear, as it might dishearten his army.
He may show what outward courage he will, but I believe, as cold a night as ’tis, he could wish himself in Thames up to the neck; and so I would he were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here.	He can act as brave as he wants, but I believe on a cold night like this he wishes he were neck-deep in the Thames, and I wish he were, too, and I with him, whatever the danger, so long as we were far away from here.
By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the king.	I’ll tell you truly what I think about the king in my heart.
I think he would not wish himself anywhere but where he is.	I don’t think he wants to be anywhere but where he is.
I dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here alone, howsoever you speak this to feel other men’s minds.	Oh, I’m sure you don’t dislike him so much as to wish he were here alone, even though you say this to find out how the rest of us feel.
Methinks I could not die anywhere so contented as in the king’s company, his cause being just and his quarrel honorable.	I don’t think there’s anywhere I’d rather die than in the king’s company, as his cause is just and honorable.
That’s more than we know.	That’s more than we know.
If his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us.	If his cause is wrong, our obedience to the king clears us of responsibility for it.
But if the cause be not good, the king himself hath a heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs and arms and heads, chopped off in a battle, shall join together at the latter day, and cry all, “We died at such a place,” some swearing, some crying for a surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their children rawly left.	But if the cause is not just, the king himself will have a lot to answer for, when all those legs and arms and heads chopped off in battle shall join together on Judgment Day crying, “We died at such and such a place.” Some will be swearing, some crying for a surgeon, some for the wives that are destitute without them, some about the debts they owed, some for their children left unprovided for.
I am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle, for how can they charitably dispose of anything, when blood is their argument?	I think few die well who die in battle.
The king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of his servant, for they purpose not their death, when they purpose their services.	The father and the master and the king didn’t order their subordinates' deaths when they ordered their services.
Besides, there is no king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to the arbitrament of swords, can try it out with all unspotted soldiers.	Besides, there’s no king, however pure his cause, who, if it comes to a trial by combat, can rely on using completely blameless soldiers.
Now, if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment, though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to fly from God.	Even if these men have escaped the law and punishment at home, they cannot escape God.
Where they feared the death, they have borne life away; and where they would be safe, they perish.	When they feared death, they escaped with their lives; and now where they imagine they’re safe, they perish.
Then, if they die unprovided, no more is the king guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited.	So, if they die unprepared, the king is no more guilty of their damnation than he was guilty of the earlier crimes they’re finally being punished for.
Every subject’s duty is the king’s, but every subject’s soul is his own.	Every subject’s duty is the king’s, but every subject’s soul is his own.
Therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed: wash every mote out of his conscience.	Therefore, every soldier should do as any man who is sick in his bed would do: clear his conscience of any stain.
And, dying so, death is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained.	Then if he dies, his death serves him.
Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill upon his own head.	It’s clear, every man must take responsibility for the manner of his own death.
The king is not to answer it.	The king is not responsible for it.
I do not desire he should answer for me, and yet I determine to fight lustily for him.	I don’t expect him to answer for me, and yet I’m determined to fight vigorously for him.
I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed.	I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed.
If I live to see it, I will never trust his word after.	If I live to see it, I’ll never trust his word again.
You pay him then.	Yeah, right, go get him.
That’s a perilous shot out of an elder gun, that a poor and private displeasure can do against a monarch.	That’s a lame threat from a toy gun, a poor individual’s private displeasure with a monarch.
You may as well go about to turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a peacock’s feather.	You may as well try to turn the sun to ice by fanning its face with a peacock feather.
You’ll “never trust his word after.” Come, ’tis a foolish saying.	You’ll “never trust his word again.” Come on, that was a stupid thing to say.
Your reproof is something too round.	Your scolding is somewhat overblown.
I should be angry with you if the time were convenient.	I’d be angry with you if the occasion allowed.
Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live.	Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live.
I embrace it.	I’m game.
How shall I know thee again?	How will I recognize you in the future?
Give me any gage of thine, and I will wear it in my bonnet.	Give me some trinket of yours, and I will wear it in my hat.
Then, if ever thou dar’st acknowledge it, I will make it my quarrel.	Then, if you dare to acknowledge it, I’ll take up my quarrel with you.
There.	Here.
This will I also wear in my cap.	I’ll also wear this in my cap.
If ever thou come to me and say, after tomorrow, “This is my glove,” by this hand I will take thee a box on the ear.	If you come to me after tomorrow and say, “That’s my glove,” I swear by this hand, I will take it and give you a box on the ear.
If ever I live to see it, I will challenge it.	If I ever see it, I will challenge you.
Thou dar’st as well be hanged.	You may as well undertake to be hanged.
Well, I will do it, though I take thee in the king’s company.	I’ll do it even if I find you in the company of the king himself.
Keep thy word.	Keep your word.
Fare thee well.	Farewell.
Indeed, the French may lay twenty French crowns to one they will beat us, for they bear them on their shoulders.	Indeed, the French can bet twenty French crowns to one that they’ll beat us, they have such an army.
But it is no English treason to cut French crowns, and tomorrow the king himself will be a clipper.	But it’s no treason for an Englishman to cut off a French crown—a head, I mean—and tomorrow the king himself will do some snipping.
Of what your reverence shall incite us to.	to wage war.
Therefore take heed how you impawn our person, How you awake our sleeping sword of war.	I charge you, in the name of God, be careful what you say.
Under this conjuration, speak, my lord, For we will hear, note, and believe in heart That what you speak is in your conscience washed As pure as sin with baptism.	With this in mind, speak, my lord.
Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers That owe yourselves, your lives, and services To this imperial throne.	Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and all you peers who owe your lives and duty to this imperial throne.
Upon the king!	Upon the king!
Let us our lives, our souls, our debts, our careful wives, our children, and our sins lay on the king!	Let’s lay everything upon the king: our lives, our souls, our debts, our anxious wives, our children, and our sins.” I must bear responsibility for all of it.
We must bear all.	What a painful condition responsibility is.
O hard condition, Twin-born with greatness, subject to the breath Of every fool, whose sense no more can feel But his own wringing.	It goes along with being born to greatness, but it makes you get badmouthed by every fool who only has his own suffering to care about.
What infinite heart’s ease Must kings neglect that private men enjoy?	What infinite peace do king’s give up that private men enjoy?
And what have kings that privates have not too, Save ceremony, save general ceremony?	What do kings have that private men do not, besides the pomp of their position?
And what art thou, thou idol ceremony?	And what is this useless ceremony of kings?
What kind of god art thou, that suffer’st more Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers?	What kind of god is ceremony, which suffers more than its worshippers do?
What are thy comings in?	What income, what profit does it bring in?
O ceremony, show me but thy worth!	Oh, ceremony, only show me your value!
What is thy soul of adoration?	Why are you adored?
Art thou aught else but place, degree, and form, Creating awe and fear in other men, Wherein thou art less happy, being feared, Than they in fearing?	You’re less happy, being feared, than they are in fearing you.
What drink’st thou oft, instead of homage sweet, But poisoned flattery?	What do you get to drink, instead of sweet obedience, but poisonous flattery?
Oh, be sick, great greatness, And bid thy ceremony give thee cure!	Try being sick, great greatness, and see if ceremony can cure you!
Think’st thou the fiery fever will go out With titles blown from adulation?	Do you think fiery fever can be put out by the windy puff of titles?

Canst thou, when thou command’st the beggar’s knee, Command the health of it?	You can command a beggar to bow on bended knee, but can you take possession of his health?
No, thou proud dream, That play’st so subtly with a king’s repose.	No, vain illusion, so intricately bound up with a king’s rest.
And, but for ceremony, such a wretch, Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep, Had the forehand and vantage of a king.	dusk and all night long sleeps in peace.

I’ll be before thee.	I’ll meet you there.
I shall do’t, my lord.	Consider it done, my lord.
O God of battles, steel my soldiers' hearts.	Oh God of battles, bolster my soldiers' courage.
Possess them not with fear.	Don’t let them know fear.
Take from them now The sense of reck'ning ere th' opposèd numbers Pluck their hearts from them.	Rob them of the ability to count before the numbers against them overwhelm their courage.
Not today, O Lord, Oh, not today, think not upon the fault My father made in compassing the crown.	And just for today, Oh, Lord, just today don’t think of the crime my father committed in seizing the crown!
I Richard’s body have interrèd anew, And on it have bestowed more contrite tears Than from it issued forcèd drops of blood.	I’ve transferred Richard’s body to a new grave and on it poured more tears of remorse than it has shed drops of blood.
Five hundred poor I have in yearly pay, Who twice a day their withered hands hold up Toward heaven to pardon blood.	I’ve hired five hundred almsmen to hold up their withered hands to heaven, praying for my pardon twice a day throughout the year.
And I have built Two chantries where the sad and solemn priests Sing still for Richard’s soul.	And I’ve built two chapels where solemn priests sing continually for Richard’s soul.
More will I do— Though all that I can do is nothing worth, Since that my penitence comes after all, Imploring pardon.	I will do more, though nothing I can do is any good since this remorse comes after the crime, asking for pardon.

If we are marked to die, we are enough To do our country loss; and if to live, The fewer men, the greater share of honor.	If we are slated to die, the fewer, the better for our country, and if we’re slated to live, the fewer men, the greater the share of honor for each of us.

By Jove, I am not covetous for gold Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost; It yearns me not if men my garments wear; Such outward things dwell not in my desires.	By God, I am not selfish when it comes to money: I don’t care who eats at my expense.
But if it be a sin to covet honor, I am the most offending soul alive.	But if it is a sin to be selfish about honor, I am the most guilty soul alive.
No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England.	No, my cousin, don’t wish that even one man who is now in England were here instead.
God’s peace, I would not lose so great an honor As one man more, methinks, would share from me, For the best hope I have.	By God, I wouldn’t lose as much honor as a single man more would cost me, I think—not even if it meant giving up my best hope for victory.
Oh, do not wish one more!	Oh, do not wish one more!

Moreover, out of mercy, the Constable urges you to remind your men to make their peace with God and repent, so that their souls may depart sweetly and peacefully from these fields where, poor wretches, their bodies will likely fall and fester.
Who hath sent thee now?	Who sent you this time?
The constable of France.	The Constable of France.
I pray thee, bear my former answer back.	Be good enough to take back the same answer I gave before.
Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones.	Tell them to capture me, then sell my bones.
The man that once did sell the lion’s skin While the beast lived was killed with hunting him.	The man that once sold the skin of a lion while the beast still lived died hunting him.
A many of our bodies shall no doubt Find native graves, upon the which, I trust, Shall witness live in brass of this day’s work.	And on their graves, I trust, the story of this day’s work will be written in brass.
And those that leave their valiant bones in France, Dying like men though buried in your dunghills, They shall be famed; for there the sun shall greet them And draw their honors reeking up to heaven, Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime,	And those who leave their valiant bones in France, dying like men though buried in your dunghills—they’ll be remembered, too.
Besides, their writers say, King Pepin, which deposèd Childeric, Did, as heir general, being descended Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair, Make claim and title to the crown of France.	Besides, according to the French historians, King Pepin, who deposed Childeric, based his own claim to the crown of France on his descent from Blithild, the daughter of King Clothair.
Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great, To find his title with some shows of truth, Though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught, Conveyed himself as th' heir to th' Lady Lingare, Daughter to Charlemagne, who was the son To Lewis the Emperor, and Lewis the son Of Charles the Great.	Another case: Hugh Capet, who usurped the crown from Charles the duke of Lorraine—sole male heir in a direct line from Charles the Great—passed himself off as heir to Lady Lingare, daughter of Charlemagne, who was the son of Lewis the Emperor (who was the son of Charles the Great), in order to give his claim to the throne more validity (though, in fact, the claim was completely false and worthless).
Also King Lewis the Tenth, Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet, Could not keep quiet in his conscience, Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother, Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare, Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine, By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great Was reunited to the crown of France.	Another case: King Lewis the Tenth, who was sole heir to the usurper Capet, could not rest easy as king until he was assured that Queen Isabel, his grandmother, was a direct descendent of the Lady Ermengare, daughter of the aforementioned Charles duke of Lorraine, by which marriage the line of Charles the Great was reunited with the throne of France.
So that, as clear as is the summer’s sun, King Pepin’s title and Hugh Capet’s claim, King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear To hold in right and title of the female.	Thus, it should be clear as day that King Pepin’s title, Hugh Capet’s claim, and the resolution of King Lewis’s doubts all plainly derive from the female.
Let me speak proudly: tell the constable We are but warriors for the working day; Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirched With rainy marching in the painful field.	Let me speak proudly: tell the Constable we’re only workaday soldiers.
There’s not a piece of feather in our host— Good argument, I hope, we will not fly— And time hath worn us into slovenry.	There’s not a strand of feather left in our whole army—a good sign, I hope, that we won’t fly away like birds—and time on the field has made us slovenly.

We are enough yet living in the field To smother up the English in our throngs, If any order might be thought upon.	There are enough of us still alive in the field to overcome the English with our numbers if we could just restore some kind of order.

In which array, brave soldier, doth he lie, Larding the plain, and by his bloody side, Yoke-fellow to his honor-owing wounds, The noble earl of Suffolk also lies.	By his side lies the noble earl of Suffolk, York’s comrade and equal in brave wounds.
Suffolk first died, and York, all haggled over, Comes to him where in gore he lay insteeped And takes him by the beard, kisses the gashes That bloodily did yawn upon his face.	Suffolk died first, and York, cut to pieces, came to him where he lay in his blood and took him by the face, kissing his gashes.
And cries aloud, “Tarry, my cousin Suffolk.	He cried out, “Wait for me, dear cousin.

So do the kings of France unto this day, Howbeit they would hold up this Salic law To bar your Highness claiming from the female And rather choose to hide them in a net Than amply to imbar their crooked titles Usurped from you and your progenitors.	To this day, the kings of France follow this unspoken rule, even though they point to this Salic law to bar your Highness from inheriting it through the female line.

But there’s a saying very old and true: “If that you will France win, Then with Scotland first begin.” For once the eagle England being in prey, To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs, Playing the mouse in absence of the cat, To ’tame and havoc more than she can eat.

The even mead, that erst brought sweetly forth The freckled cowslip, burnet, and green clover, Wanting the scythe, withal uncorrected, rank, Conceives by idleness, and nothing teems But hateful docks, rough thistles, kecksies, burrs, Losing both beauty and utility.	The level meadow, where the freckled cowslip, burnet, and green clover once grew, has become useless: unmowed, it grows to seed, so that nothing springs up but weeds, rough thistles, barren plants, and burs.
And as our vineyards, fallows, meads, and hedges, Defective in their natures, grow to wildness, Even so our houses and ourselves and children Have lost, or do not learn for want of time, The sciences that should become our country, But grow like savages, as soldiers will	children have lost—or no longer have time to learn—skills that should be a credit to our country.
That nothing do but meditate on blood, To swearing and stern looks, diffused attire, And everything that seems unnatural.	They grow like savages—like soldiers who meditate on nothing but blood—surrounded by swearing and stern looks, ragged clothing and everything unnatural.

The king hath heard them, to the which as yet There is no answer made.	The king has heard them, but as yet has made no answer.
Well then, the peace which you before so urged Lies in his answer.	Well, the peace you pleaded for so eloquently just now lies in his answer.
I have but with a cursitory eye O'erglanced the articles.	I’ve only given the articles a cursory glance.
Pleaseth your Grace To appoint some of your council presently To sit with us once more with better heed To resurvey them, we will suddenly Pass our accept and peremptory answer.	If your Grace would kindly appoint some members of your council to sit with me once more and go over them more carefully, I will give my answer and acceptance right away.
And we’ll consign thereto.—Will you, fair sister, Go with the princes or stay here with us?	Fair sister, will you go with the princes or stay here with me?
Our gracious brother, I will go with them.	Gracious brother, I will go with them.
Haply a woman’s voice may do some good, When articles too nicely urged be stood on.	Perhaps a woman’s voice may do some good when some small detail proves to be holding things up.
Yet leave our cousin Katherine here with us.	In that case, leave our cousin Katherine here with us.
She is our capital demand, comprised Within the forerank of our articles.	She is our principal demand—one of the first points of the treaty.
She hath good leave.	She is welcome to stay.
Fair Katherine, and most fair, Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady’s ear And plead his love suit to her gentle heart?	Lovely, most lovely Katherine, will you agree to teach a soldier the words that would recommend his love-suit to a gentle heart like yours?

O fair Katherine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue.	Lovely Katherine, if you will love me well with your French heart, I’m happy to hear you confess it in broken English.
Do you like me, Kate?	Do you like me, Kate?
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.	Pardon me but I do not know what is “like me.” An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
I said so, dear Katherine; and I must not blush to affirm it.	I said so, dear Katherine, and I’m not ashamed to repeat it.
The princess is the better Englishwoman.—I' faith, Kate, my wooing is fit for thy understanding.	Kate, my wooing is fit for your understanding: I am glad your English isn’t better.
I am glad thou canst speak no better English, for if thou couldst, thou wouldst find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my crown.	If it were, you would find me such an ordinary king that you would think I’d sold my farm to buy my crown.
I know no ways to mince it in love, but directly to say, “I love you.” Then if you urge me farther than to say, “Do you, in faith?” I wear out my suit.	I don’t know any fancy ways of talking about love, only to say right out, “I love you.” If you press me any further than with the question, “Do you really?” my love scene is over.
Give me your answer, i' faith, do; and so clap hands and a bargain.	So give me your answer, and we’ll shake on it.
How say you, lady?	Deal?
For the one, I have neither words nor measure; and for the other, I have no strength in measure, yet a reasonable measure in strength.	I have no gift for the one and no strength for the other, though I have the gift of strength.
If I could win a lady at leapfrog or by vaulting into my saddle with my armor on my back, under the correction of bragging be it spoken, I should quickly leap into a wife.	If I could win a lady by playing leapfrog or vaulting into my saddle with my armor on my back—though you may accuse me of boasting—I could easily get myself a wife.
If thou canst love a fellow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth sunburning, that never looks in his glass for love of anything he sees there, let thine eye be thy cook.	If you can love a man of this temperament, Kate, whose face a sunburn wouldn’t make any worse and who never looks in the mirror to admire himself, let your eye improve me.
I speak to thee plain soldier.	I speak to you as a plain soldier.
If thou canst love me for this, take me.	If you can love me for this, take me.
If not, to say to thee that I shall die is true, but for thy love, by the Lord, no.	If not, to tell you I will die is true, but not for love, by God.
Yet I love thee too.	And yet I do love you.
And while thou liv’st, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and uncoined constancy, for he perforce must do thee right because he hath not the gift to woo in other places.	So take for life a fellow of pure and plain faithfulness.
For these fellows of infinite tongue, that can rhyme themselves into ladies' favors, they do always reason themselves out again.	These chatty fellows who can rhyme their way into a lady’s good graces always reason themselves out again.
If thou would have such a one, take me.	If you would have such a man, take me.
And what say’st thou then to my love?	So what do you say to my suit?
Speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.	Speak, my fair one, and speak fairly, I beg you.
Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France?	Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France?
No, it is not possible you should love the enemy of France, Kate.	No, it is not possible you should love the enemy of France, Kate.
But, in loving me, you should love the friend of France, for I love France so well that I will not part with a village of it.	But in loving me, you would love the friend of France, for I love France so much that I will not part with a single village of it.

I’ll ask them.	I’ll ask them.
But, good Kate, mock me mercifully, the rather, gentle princess, because I love thee cruelly.	But mock me gently, dear Kate, because I love you terribly.
Shall we not?	Shall we not?
What say’st thou, my fair flower de luce?	What do you say, my fair  I do not know dat.
I do not know dat.	No, of course you don’t.
No, ’tis hereafter to know, but now to promise.	Now there can only be the promise.
Do but now promise, Kate, you will endeavor for your French part of such a boy; and for my English moiety take the word of a king and a bachelor.	Do promise, Kate, that you’ll do your French part to bring forth such a boy; and for my English half, take the word of a king and a bachelor.
By mine honor, in true English, I love thee, Kate.	I tell you truly, in true English: I love you, Kate.
By which honor I dare not swear thou lovest me, yet my blood begins to flatter me that thou dost, notwithstanding the poor and untempering effect of my visage.	And though I wouldn’t dare to swear that you love me, still my blood begins to flatter me that you do, despite the ill effects of my face.
Now, beshrew my father’s ambition!	Curse my father’s ambition!
But, in faith, Kate, the elder I wax, the better I shall appear.	But I promise you, Kate: the older I grow the better I’ll look.
My comfort is that old age, that ill layer-up of beauty, can do no more spoil upon my face.	My comfort is that old age, that poor preserver of beauty, can’t make my face any worse than it already is.
Thou hast me, if thou hast me, at the worst, and thou shalt wear me, if thou wear me, better and better.	If you have me, you have me now at my worst; and if you have me, you’ll appreciate me better and better.
And therefore tell me, most fair Katherine, will you have me?	Therefore tell me, fairest Katherine, will you have me?

Wilt thou have me?	Will you have me?

Your  It is not a fashion for the maids in France to kiss before they are married, would she say?	It is not the custom for the maids in France to kiss before they are married, is that what she says?
O Kate, nice customs curtsy to great kings.	Oh, Kate, prudish customs bow before great kings.
Dear Kate, you and I cannot be confined within the weak list of a country’s fashion.	You and I cannot be held within the confines of a country’s arbitrary customs, dear Kate.
We are the makers of manners, Kate, and the liberty that follows our places stops the mouth of all find- faults, as I will do yours for upholding the nice fashion of your country in denying me a kiss.	You and I, Kate, we are the makers of custom, and the freedom that goes with our position silences all who would criticize, as I will silence you for upholding the prudish custom of your country in refusing me a kiss.
Therefore, patiently and yielding.	Therefore, willingly and yielding.
God save your Majesty.	God save your Majesty.
My royal cousin, teach you our princess English?	My royal kinsman, are you teaching our princess English?
I would have her learn, my fair cousin, how perfectly I love her, and that is good English.	I wanted to teach her how perfectly I love her, kinsman, and that’s good English.
Is she not apt?	She picks it up quick, doesn’t she?
Our tongue is rough, coz, and my condition is not smooth, so that, having neither the voice nor the heart of flattery about me, I cannot so conjure up the spirit of love in her that he will appear in his true likeness.	So, possessing neither a voice nor a heart for flattery, I can’t awaken the spirit of love in her so as to make him appear in his true likeness.
I this infer: That many things, having full reference To one consent, may work contrariously, As many arrows loosèd several ways Come to one mark, as many ways meet in one town, As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea, As many lines close in the dial’s center, So may a thousand actions, once afoot, End in one purpose, and be all well borne Without defeat.	From this, I conclude that many different elements can work toward one common end—just as many arrows, shot from different points, converge on a single target; just as many roads meet in a single town; just as many fresh streams empty into only one salt sea; just as the many radiuses of a
Pardon the frankness of my mirth if I answer you for that.	Forgive my boldness if I take you up on your words about making magic.
If you would conjure in her, you must make a circle; if conjure up Love in her in his true likeness, he must appear naked and blind.	For love to appear in his true likeness, he would have to be as Cupid is: naked and blind.
Can you blame her then, being a maid yet rosed over with the virgin crimson of modesty, if she deny the appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing self?	How can you blame her, a tender young maiden still given to virgin blushes, for objecting to having a blind, naked boy appear before her?
It were, my lord, a hard condition for a maid to consign to.	It’s a lot to ask of a maiden.
They are then excused, my lord, when they see not what they do.	They’re forgiven, then, if they don’t see what they’re doing.
Then, good my lord, teach your cousin to consent winking.	Then teach your cousin to also be willing to close her eyes, my lord.
This moral ties me over to time and a hot summer.	So you’re telling me to give it time and wait for summer.
And so I shall catch the fly, your cousin, in the latter end and she must be blind too.	And even then, in order for me to catch the fly your cousin, she must be blind?
As love is, my lord, before it loves.	Like love, my lord, before it learns to love.
It is so.	Fair enough.
Shall Kate be my wife?	Shall Kate be my wife?
So please you.	If you wish.
I am content, so the maiden cities you talk of may wait on her.	I am satisfied, as long as the maiden cities you talk of come with her.
So the maid that stood in the way for my wish shall show me the way to my will.	That way, the maiden that stood between me and them shall be the means of my achieving my desire.
We have consented to all terms of reason.	We have consented to all reasonable terms.
Is ’t so, my lords of England?	Is that true, my lords of England?
The king hath granted every article, His daughter first, and, in sequel, all, According to their firm proposed natures.	The king has agreed to every point: first his daughter, then everything else, as you strictly proposed.
Only he hath not yet subscribèd this: Where your Majesty demands that the king of France, having any occasion to write for matter of grant, shall name your Highness in this form and with this addition, in French:  Nor this I have not, brother, so denied But your request shall make me let it pass.	Except that he has not yet agreed to address you in this form and with this title—in French,  And even this I’m willing to grant if you request it.
I pray you, then, in love and dear alliance, Let that one article rank with the rest, And thereupon give me your daughter.	In that case, I ask that for the sake of friendship and alliance you let that one item stand with the rest, and bestow your daughter on me.
Amen.	Amen.

Then shall I swear to Kate, and you to me, And may our oaths well kept and prosp'rous be.	Then I will swear to Kate and you to me, and may our oaths be faithfully kept and prove fortunate.
Thus far with rough and all-unable pen Our bending author hath pursued the story, In little room confining mighty men, Mangling by starts the full course of their glory.	Thus far has our straining author pursued the story with his crude, inadequate writing, keeping important people penned up in this little room while he mangled history’s full glory with his uneven telling.
Henry the Sixth, in infant bands crowned king Of France and England, did this king succeed, Whose state so many had the managing That they lost France and made his England bleed, Which oft our stage hath shown.	Henry the Sixth, crowned king of France and England while still in his infancy, succeeded him.
And for their sake, In your fair minds let this acceptance take.	With those plays in mind, we hope you’ll receive this one kindly.
If we, with thrice such powers left at home, Cannot defend our own doors from the dog, Let us be worried, and our nation lose The name of hardiness and policy.	If we cannot defend our country with three times such a power left at home, then we deserve to be harassed by an invader and lose our reputation as a powerful and politically savvy nation.

Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts.	Let your thoughts make up for our imperfections.
Into a thousand parts divide one man, And make imaginary puissance.	Divide each man into a thousand, and there you will have an imaginary army.
Think, when we talk of horses, that you see them Printing their proud hoofs i' th' receiving earth, For ’tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings, Carry them here and there, jumping o'er times,	Imagine, when we talk of horses, that you see them planting their proud hooves in the soft earth.
We are no tyrant, but a Christian king, Unto whose grace our passion is as subject As is our wretches fettered in our prisons.	I am no tyrant but a Christian king, whose emotions are as tightly controlled as the wretches who languish in our prisons.
Therefore with frank and with uncurbèd plainness Tell us the Dauphin’s mind.	Therefore tell me the Dauphin’s mind frankly and without constraint.
You cannot revel into dukedoms there.	You can’t party your way into dukedoms there.
He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit, This tun of treasure, and, in lieu of this, Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim Hear no more of you.	And in return for this gift, he wishes you to drop your claim to the dukedoms.

We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us.	I’m happy the Dauphin has such a good sense of humor.
His present and your pains we thank you for.	Thank you for his present and your trouble.
When we have matched our rackets to these balls, We will in France, by God’s grace, play a set Shall strike his father’s crown into the hazard.	Once I’ve put my rackets to these balls, I’ll play a set in France, God willing, that will knock his father’s crown right out of the court.
And we understand him well, How he comes o'er us with our wilder days, Not measuring what use we made of them.	And I understand perfectly his sneering reference to my wilder days.
We never valued this poor seat of England And therefore, living hence, did give ourself To barbarous license, as ’tis ever common That men are merriest when they are from home.	Men tend to be at their most irresponsible when they’re away from home.
So get you hence in peace.	So go in peace.
And tell the Dauphin His jest will savor but of shallow wit When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.	And tell the Dauphin his joke will look pretty stupid when thousands more weep than ever laughed at it.
This was a merry message.	That was a humorous message.
We hope to make the sender blush at it.	I hope to make the sender blush for it.
Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour That may give furth'rance to our expedition; For we have now no thought in us but France, Save those to God, that run before our business.	Now, lords, don’t let slip any opportunity that might be advantageous for our expedition.
Therefore let every man now task his thought, That this fair action may on foot be brought.	Therefore, let every man give some thought to how this noble expedition may be undertaken.

From there we’ll safely carry you to France and back, calming the waters of the Channel to provide you with a smooth voyage.
But, till the king come forth, and not till then, Unto Southampton do we shift our scene.	But we won’t shift the scene to Southampton until Henry reappears.

No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.	No doubt it will, my liege, if each man does his best.

To which we all appeal.	To which we all appeal.

Tis so strange That, though the truth of it stands off as gross As black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.	Though the truth of your treachery is as plain as black on white, I can scarcely believe it, it’s so past understanding.
Treason and murder ever kept together As two yoke-devils sworn to either’s purpose, Working so grossly in a natural cause That admiration did not whoop at them.	All other devils who tempt people to treason patch together some motive, put together from shreds

Therefore,  Go, clear thy crystals.—Yoke-fellows in arms, Let us to France, like horse-leeches, my boys, To suck, to suck, the very blood to suck.	My lord, this bill that’s being proposed is the same one that was proposed in the eleventh year of old King Henry’s reign.
My lord, I’ll tell you that self bill is urged Which in th' eleventh year of the last king’s reign Was like, and had indeed against us passed But that the scambling and unquiet time Did push it out of farther question.	Everyone thought it would pass then, and it probably would have had it not been for the great civil unrest and uncertainty of the time, which required the matter to be put off.
But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?	But how will we keep it from being passed now, my lord?
It must be thought on.	We have to think about that.
If it pass against us, We lose the better half of our possession, For all the temporal lands which men devout By testament have given to the Church Would they strip from us, being valued thus: “As much as would maintain, to the King’s honor, Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights, Six thousand and two hundred good esquires; And, to relief of lazars and weak age Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil, A hundred almshouses right well supplied; And to the coffers of the King besides, A thousand pounds by th' year.” Thus runs the bill.	If it does pass, the Church will lose more than half of what it possesses, because the bill would strip us of enough real estate left to the church by wealthy, pious men in their wills to support fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights, six thousand two hundred squires, and a hundred well-supplied almshouses for the relief of lepers, old-age pensioners, the poor, and those too weak or sick to work.

Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?	Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?

Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius, That you would have me seek into myself For that which is not in me?	What dangers would you lead me into, Cassius, That you want me to search for something That I don’t have in myself?
Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear, And since you know you cannot see yourself So well as by reflection, I your glass Will modestly discover to yourself That of yourself which you yet know not of.	For that reason, good Brutus, get ready to hear what I have to say; And since you know you can’t see yourself Except in a mirror, I’ll be your mirror, And will modestly let you see That in yourself which you don’t know about.
And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus; Were I a common laugher, or did use To stale with ordinary oaths my love To every new protester, if you know That I do fawn on men and hug them hard And after scandal them, or if you know That I profess myself in banqueting To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.	And don’t be angry with me, gentle Brutus; I wish I were a common comedian, or used To urinating on my friendship with ordinary oaths To every new opponent; if you know That I show false friendship to some men, and hug them hard And after that, tell lies about them, or if you know That I profess myself at feasts to be friends with The entire place, then think about me dangerous.

The noble Brutus Hath told you Caesar was ambitious.	The noble Brutus told you that Caesar was ambitious.

He would not take the crown.	Caesar wouldn’t take the crown.
Therefore ’tis certain he was not ambitious.	Therefore it’s certain that he wasn’t ambitious.
If it be found so, some will dear abide it.	If it turns out he wasn’t, certain people are going to get it.
Poor soul!	Poor man!
His eyes are red as fire with weeping.	Antony’s eyes are fiery red from crying.
There’s not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.	There isn’t a nobler man than Antony in all of Rome.
But yesterday the word of Caesar might Have stood against the world.	Only yesterday the word of Caesar might have stood against the world.
Now lies he there, And none so poor to do him reverence.	Now he lies there worth nothing, and no one is so humble as to show him respect.

Let but the commons hear this testament— Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read— And they would go and kiss dead Caesar’s wounds And dip their napkins in his sacred blood, Yea, beg a hair of him for memory, And, dying, mention it within their wills, Bequeathing it as a rich legacy Unto their issue.

Oh, now you weep, and, I perceive, you feel The dint of pity.	Oh, now you weep, and I sense that you feel pity.
These are gracious drops.	These are gracious tears.
Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold Our Caesar’s vesture wounded?	But if it overwhelms you to look at Caesar’s wounded cloak, how will you feel, kind men, now?

They that have done this deed are honorable.	Those who have done this deed are honorable.
What private griefs they have, alas, I know not, That made them do it.	I don’t know what private grudges they had that made them do it.
They are wise and honorable, And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.	They’re wise and honorable, and will no doubt give you reasons for it.

For I have neither wit nor words nor worth, Action nor utterance nor the power of speech, To stir men’s blood.	I have neither cleverness nor rhetorical skill nor the authority nor gesture nor eloquence nor the power of speech to stir men up.
I only speak right on.	I just speak directly.
But were I Brutus, And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue In every wound of Caesar that should move The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.	But if I were Brutus and Brutus were me, then I’d stir you up, and install in each of Caesar’s wounds the kind of voice that could convince even stones to rise up and mutiny.

Here was a Caesar!	Here was a Caesar!
When comes such another?	When will there be another like him?
We’ll burn his body in the holy place, And with the brands fire the traitors' houses.	We’ll burn his body in the holy place and use the brands to set the traitors' houses on fire.
Take up the body.	Take up the body.
Go fetch fire.	We’ll start a fire.

Where is he?	Where is he?
He and Lepidus are at Caesar’s house.	He and Lepidus are at Caesar’s house.
And thither will I straight to visit him.	I will go straight to visit him.

I heard him say, Brutus and Cassius Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.	I heard Octavius say that Brutus and Cassius have ridden like madmen through the gates of Rome.
Belike they had some notice of the people How I had moved them.	They probably received warning about how much I stirred up the people.
Bring me to Octavius.	Take me to Octavius.
Tis just.	That’s true.
And it is very much lamented, Brutus, That you have no such mirrors as will turn Your hidden worthiness into your eye That you might see your shadow.	And it’s too bad, Brutus, that you don’t have any mirrors that could display your hidden excellence to yourself.
I have heard Where many of the best respect in Rome, Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus And groaning underneath this age’s yoke, Have wished that noble Brutus had his eyes.	I’ve heard many of the noblest Romans—next to immortal Caesar—speaking of you, complaining of the tyranny of today’s government, and wishing that your eyes were working better.
Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius, That you would have me seek into myself For that which is not in me?	What dangers are you trying to lead me into, Cassius, that you want me to look inside myself for something that’s not there?
Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear.	I’ll tell you, good Brutus.
And since you know you cannot see yourself So well as by reflection, I, your glass, Will modestly discover to yourself That of yourself which you yet know not of.	And since you know you can see yourself best by reflection, I’ll be your mirror and show you, without exaggeration, things inside you that you can’t see.
And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus.	And don’t be suspicious of me, noble Brutus.
Were I a common laugher, or did use To stale with ordinary oaths my love To every new protester, if you know That I do fawn on men and hug them hard And, after, scandal them, or if you know That I profess myself in banqueting To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.	If I were your average fool, or if I made my feelings for you worthless by making the same promises of friendship to everybody, or if you’d seen me first flattering men, hugging them tightly, and later slandering them behind their backs, or if you hear that I drunkenly declare friendship at banquets with all the rabble, only then, of course, go ahead and assume I’m dangerous.
What means this shouting?	Why are they shouting?
I do fear, the people Choose Caesar for their king.	I’m afraid the people have made Caesar their king.
Ay, do you fear it?	Really, are you afraid of that?
Then must I think you would not have it so.	Then I have to assume you don’t want him to be king.
I dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar, And things unlucky charge my fantasy.	I dreamed last night that I feasted with Caesar, and unlucky signs overwhelmed my imagination.

Some to Ligarius'.	Some to Ligarius’s.
Away, go!	Go!
These many, then, shall die.	These ones, then, will be assassinated.

I do consent—    Prick him down, Antony.	I agree— Put a mark next to his name too, Antony.
Upon condition Publius shall not live, Who is your sister’s son, Mark Antony.	On the condition that your sister’s son, Publius, also must die, Mark Antony.

What, shall I find you here?	Will you be here when I return?
Or here, or at the Capitol.	Either here or at the Capitol.
This is a slight, unmeritable man, Meet to be sent on errands.	He’s an unremarkable man, fit only to be sent on errands.
Is it fit, The threefold world divided, he should stand One of the three to share it?	Does it really make sense, once we divide the world into three parts, that he should be one of the three rulers?
Octavius, I have seen more days than you.	Octavius, I’m older than you are.
And though we lay these honors on this man To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads, He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold, To groan and sweat under the business, Either led or driven, as we point the way.	And although we’re giving these honors to this man so that he shares some of the blame for what we’re doing, he’ll carry these honors like a jackass carries gold—groaning and sweating under the load, either led or pushed, as we direct him.
And having brought our treasure where we will, Then take we down his load and turn him off, Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears And graze in commons.	Once he’s carried our treasure where we want it, we’ll free him of the load and turn him loose like a jackass, to shake his ears and graze in the public pastures.
You may do your will, But he’s a tried and valiant soldier.	You can do what you want, but he’s an experienced and honorable soldier.
So is my horse, Octavius, and for that I do appoint him store of provender.	So is my horse, Octavius, and for that reason I give him all the hay he wants.
Stand, ho!	Stop.
Give the word, ho, and stand.	Pass on the command to halt!

He is at hand, and Pindarus is come To do you salutation from his master.	He’s nearby, and Pindarus has come to salute you on behalf of his master.
But if he be at hand I shall be satisfied.	If he’s nearby, I want an explanation.
He is not doubted.—A word, Lucillius.	Can I have a word with you, Lucillius?
But not with such familiar instances Nor with such free and friendly conference As he hath used of old.	He received me with courtesy and sufficient respect, but not with affection, nor with as much open and friendly conversation as he once greeted me.
Thou hast described A hot friend cooling.	You’ve described a warm friend who’s cooling off.
There are no tricks in plain and simple faith.	Plain and simple loyalty doesn’t make anyone act phony.
But hollow men, like horses hot at hand, Make gallant show and promise of their mettle.	But insincere men, like horses who are too lively at the start of a race, make a big show of their spirit.
But when they should endure the bloody spur, They fall their crests and, like deceitful jades, Sink in the trial.	But when push comes to shove, they droop like those horses that are all show and slow to a crawl.
Comes his army on?	Is his army approaching?
They mean this night in Sardis to be quartered.	They plan to spend the night in Sardis.
The greater part, the horse in general, Are come with Cassius.	The larger part, the main body of cavalry, are coming with Cassius.
Hark!	Look!
He is arrived.	He’s arrived.
March gently on to meet him.	March to meet him at a dignified pace.
Stand, ho!	Halt.
Stand, ho!	Halt!
Speak the word along.	Pass the order along.
Stand!	Halt!
Stand!	Halt!
Stand!	Halt!
Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.	Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.
Judge me, you gods!	Let the gods judge me!
Wrong I mine enemies?	Do I mistreat even my enemies?
And when you do them—     Cassius, be content.	And when you do— Cassius, calm down.
Before the eyes of both our armies here, Which should perceive nothing but love from us, Let us not wrangle.	Let’s not argue here in front of both our armies, which ought to see nothing but love between us.
Bid them move away.	Order them to move back.
Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs, And I will give you audience.	Then, in my tent, you can elaborate on your complaints, and I’ll listen.
Pindarus, Bid our commanders lead their charges off A little from this ground.	Pindarus, order our commanders to lead their charges a little ways away from this ground.
Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door.	Have Lucius and Titinius guard the door.
That you have wronged me doth appear in this: You have condemned and noted Lucius Pella For taking bribes here of the Sardians, Wherein my letters, praying on his side Because I knew the man, were slighted off.	My evidence that you have wronged me is that you condemned and disgraced Lucius Pella for taking bribes here from the Sardinians, and you ignored my letters, where I argued that he was innocent; I know the man.
You wronged yourself to write in such a case.	You wronged yourself to write on behalf of such a man.
In such a time as this it is not meet That every nice offense should bear his comment.	In a time like this, it doesn’t make sense to criticize every offense.
Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself Are much condemned to have an itching palm, To sell and mart your offices for gold To undeservers.	I’ll tell you, Cassius, you yourself have been called greedy and been accused of giving your positions to undeserving men in exchange for gold.
I “an itching palm”!	Me, “greedy”!
You know that you are Brutus that speak this, Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.	You know, if you were anyone other than Brutus, that speech would be your last.
The name of Cassius honors this corruption, And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.	The name of Cassius gives credit to these corrupt actions, and so they go unpunished.
Chastisement!	Unpunished!
Remember March, the ides of March remember.	Remember March, March 15th.
Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?	Didn’t great Caesar bleed for the sake of justice?
What villain touched his body, that did stab, And not for justice?	Who among us stabbed him for any cause but justice?
What, shall one of us That struck the foremost man of all this world But for supporting robbers, shall we now Contaminate our fingers with base bribes, And sell the mighty space of our large honors For so much trash as may be graspèd thus?	Should we now dirty our fingers with lowly bribes and sell the mighty offices that we hold for whatever money we can get our hands on?
I had rather be a dog and bay the moon Than such a Roman.	I’d rather be a dog and howl at the moon than be that kind of Roman.
Brutus, bait not me.	Brutus, do not provoke me.
I’ll not endure it.	I will not take it.
You forget yourself To hedge me in.	You’re forgetting yourself when you back me into a corner.
I am a soldier, I, Older in practice, abler than yourself To make conditions.	I’m a soldier, more experienced than you, and better able to give orders.
Go to.	Get lost!
You are not, Cassius.	You are not, Cassius.
I am.	I am.
I say you are not.	I say you’re not.
Urge me no more, I shall forget myself.	Don’t provoke me any further or I’ll forget to restrain myself.
Have mind upon your health, tempt me no further.	If you care about your health, you won’t push me any further.
Away, slight man!	Leave, you little man.
Is ’t possible?	Is this possible?
Hear me, for I will speak.	Listen to me, for I have something to tell you.
Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?	Does a madman scare me when he stares at me?
But wherefore do you hold me here so long?	But why do you keep me here so long?
What is it that you would impart to me?	What do you want to tell me?
I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus, As well as I do know your outward favor.	I know this quality in you, Brutus—it’s as familiar to me as your face.
Well, honor is the subject of my story.	Indeed, honor is what I want to talk to you about.
I cannot tell what you and other men Think of this life, but, for my single self, I had as lief not be as live to be In awe of such a thing as I myself.	I don’t know what you and other men think of this life, but as for me, I’d rather not live at all than live to worship a man as ordinary as myself.
I was born free as Caesar.	I was born as free as Caesar.
So were you.	So were you.
We both have fed as well, and we can both Endure the winter’s cold as well as he.	We both have eaten as well, and we can both endure the cold winter as well as he.
For once upon a raw and gusty day, The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores, Caesar said to me, “Darest thou, Cassius, now Leap in with me into this angry flood And swim to yonder point?” Upon the word, Accoutred as I was, I plungèd in And bade him follow.	Once, on a cold and windy day, when the river Tiber was crashing against its banks, Caesar said to me, “Cassius, I dare you to jump into this rough water with me and swim to that point there.” As soon as he spoke, though I was fully dressed, I plunged in and called for him to follow.
So indeed he did.	And he did.
But ere we could arrive the point proposed, Caesar cried, “Help me, Cassius, or I sink!” I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor, Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber Did I the tired Caesar.	But before we reached the end point, Caesar cried, “Help me, Cassius, or I will sink!” And just as Aeneas, the hero who founded Rome, emerged from the fires of Troy with his elderly father Anchises on his shoulder, so I emerged from the Tiber carrying the tired Caesar.
All this”?	All this”?
Ay, more.	Yes, and more.
Fret till your proud heart break.	Go ahead—rage till your proud heart breaks.
Go show your slaves how choleric you are And make your bondmen tremble.	Show your slaves how mad you are, and make your servants tremble.
Is it come to this?	Has it come to this?
You say you are a better soldier.	You say you’re a better soldier.
Let it appear so.	Show it!
Make your vaunting true, And it shall please me well.	Make your boasts come true, and I’ll be thrilled.
For mine own part, I shall be glad to learn of noble men.	I’m always happy to hear about brave men.
You wrong me every way.	You wrong me in every way.
You wrong me, Brutus.	You wrong me, Brutus.
When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.	When Caesar was alive, even he wouldn’t dare anger me like this.
Peace, peace!	Oh, be quiet.
You durst not so have tempted him.	You wouldn’t have dared to tempt him so.
I durst not!	I wouldn’t have dared!
No.	No.
For your life you durst not.	You wouldn’t have dared, out of fear for your life.
Do not presume too much upon my love.	Don’t take my love for granted.
I may do that I shall be sorry for.	I might do something I’ll be sorry for.
You have done that you should be sorry for.	You’ve already done something you should be sorry for.
There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats, For I am armed so strong in honesty That they pass by me as the idle wind, Which I respect not.	Your threats don’t scare me, Cassius, because I’m so secure in my honesty and integrity that they pass me by like a weak breeze.
I did send To you for gold to pay my legions, Which you denied me.	I asked you for gold to pay my soldiers, and you wouldn’t give it to me.
Was that done like Cassius?	Was that the Caius Cassius that I knew?
Should I have answered Caius Cassius so?	And would I have ever done that to you?
I denied you not.	I didn’t refuse you.
You did.	You did.
I did not.	I didn’t.
He was but a fool that brought My answer back.	The man who brought my answer to you was a fool.
Brutus hath rived my heart.	You have broken my heart.
A friend should bear his friend’s infirmities, But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.	A friend should put up with his friend’s weaknesses, but you exaggerate mine.
I do not, till you practice them on me.	I don’t until you practice them on me.
You love me not.	You don’t love me.
I do not like your faults.	I don’t like your faults.
A friendly eye could never see such faults.	A friend would never see those faults.
A flatterer’s would not, though they do appear As huge as high Olympus.	No, a flatterer wouldn’t, even if the faults were as huge as Mount Olympus.
Oh, I could weep My spirit from mine eyes.	Oh, I could weep my soul right out of myself!
Sheathe your dagger.	There’s my dagger  Put away your dagger.
Be angry when you will, it shall have scope.	Be angry whenever you like, it’s all right with me.
Do what you will, dishonor shall be humor.	Do whatever you want, and I’ll say your insults are just a bad mood.
When I spoke that, I was ill-tempered too.	When I said that, I was angry too.
Do you confess so much?	You admit it, then?
Give me your hand.	Give me your hand.
And my heart too.	And my heart too.
O Brutus!	Oh, Brutus!
What’s the matter?	What’s the matter?
Have not you love enough to bear with me, When that rash humor which my mother gave me Makes me forgetful?	Do you have enough love for me to be patient when my bad temper, which I inherited from my mother, makes me forget how I should behave?
Yes, Cassius.	Yes, Cassius.
And from henceforth When you are over-earnest with your Brutus, He’ll think your mother chides and leave you so.	And from now on, when you get hot with me, I’ll assume it’s your mother speaking and leave it at that.
How now?	What’s this!
What’s the matter?	What’s the matter?
For shame, you generals!	You should be ashamed, generals!
What do you mean?	What do you think you’re doing?
Love, and be friends as two such men should be.	Love each other and be friends, like two such men should be.
For I have seen more years, I’m sure, than ye.	Listen to me, because I’m older than you, surely.
Bear with him, Brutus.	Be patient with him, Brutus.
Tis his fashion.	That’s just how he is.
I’ll know his humor when he knows his time.	I’ll humor him when he learns how to behave.
What should the wars do with these jigging fools?	What should we do with all these rhyming fools that follow us from post to post?
Companion, hence!	Get out of here, my friend.
Away, away, be gone.	Away, away, be gone.
Lucillius and Titinius, bid the commanders Prepare to lodge their companies tonight.	Lucillius and Titinius, order the commanders to have the men camp for the night.
And come yourselves, and bring Messala with you, Immediately to us.	And return to us immediately, bringing Messala with you.
I did not think you could have been so angry.	I didn’t think you could even be so angry.
O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.	Oh Cassius, I’m tired out by many sorrows.
Portia is dead.	Portia is dead.
Ha, Portia?	Portia!
She is dead.	She is dead.
O insupportable and touching loss!	What an irreplaceable and grievous loss!
Upon what sickness?	What sickness did she die of?
Impatient of my absence, And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony Have made themselves so strong—for with her death That tidings came—with this she fell distract And, her attendants absent, swallowed fire.	She was worried about my absence, and about the fact that young Octavius and Mark Antony have grown so strong—which I found out at the same time as the news of her death.
And died so?	And that’s how she died?
Even so.	Yes, like that.
O ye immortal gods!	Oh, immortal gods!
My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.	My heart is thirsty for that noble promise.
Fill, Lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup.	Fill my cup, Lucius, until the wine overflows it.
I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love.	I cannot drink too much of Brutus’s love.
Now sit we close about this taper here And call in question our necessities.	Now let’s sit closely around this candle and discuss our needs.
Portia, art thou gone?	Portia, are you really gone?
No more, I pray you.	No more about that, please.
Messala, I have here receivèd letters That young Octavius and Mark Antony Come down upon us with a mighty power, Bending their expedition toward Philippi.	Messala, I have received these letters explaining that young Octavius and Mark Antony are rushing toward Philippi and bearing down upon us with a mighty power.
Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.	I have received letters that say the same.
With what addition?	And anything else?
That by proscription and bills of outlawry, Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus Have put to death an hundred senators.	That with a series of legal writs, Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus have put a hundred senators to death.
Therein our letters do not well agree.	On that point, our letters don’t agree.
Mine speak of seventy senators that died By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.	My letters say only seventy senators were killed, one being Cicero.
Cicero one?	Cicero too?
Cicero is dead, And by that order of proscription.	Cicero is dead, by their decree.
No, Messala.	No, Messala.
Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?	And you haven’t heard any news about her in your letters?
Nothing, Messala.	Nothing, Messala.
That methinks is strange.	I think that’s strange.
Why ask you?	Why do you ask?
Hear you aught of her in yours?	Have you heard something of her in your letters?
No, my lord.	No, my lord.
Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.	Now, as you’re a Roman, tell me the truth.
Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell.	Then you must take the truth I have to tell like a Roman.
For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.	It’s certain that she is dead, and she died in a strange way.
Why, farewell, Portia.	Well, good-bye, Portia.
We must die, Messala.	We all must die, Messala.
With meditating that she must die once, I have the patience to endure it now.	Having already thought about the fact that she would have to die sometime, I can endure her death now.
Even so great men great losses should endure.	That’s the way great men ought to endure great losses.
I have as much of this in art as you, But yet my nature could not bear it so.	I’ve practiced Stoicism with as much devotion as you, but I still couldn’t bear this news like you do.
Well, to our work alive.	Well, let’s move on to our work with the living.
What do you think Of marching to Philippi presently?	What do you think of marching to Philippi immediately?
I do not think it good.	I don’t think it’s a good idea.
Your reason?	Why not?
This it is: 'Tis better that the enemy seek us.	Here’s why: it’d be better for the enemy to come after us.
So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers, Doing himself offense, whilst we, lying still, Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.	That way, he’ll waste his provisions and tire out his soldiers, weakening his own capacities, while we, lying still, are rested, energetic, and nimble.
The enemy, marching along by them, By them shall make a fuller number up, Come on refreshed, new-added, and encouraged, From which advantage shall we cut him off If at Philippi we do face him there, These people at our back.	If we meet him at Philippi, these people will be at our backs.
Hear me, good brother— Under your pardon.	Listen to me, good brother.
You must note beside, That we have tried the utmost of our friends, Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe.	Our regiments are full to the brim; our cause is ready.
The enemy increaseth every day.	The enemy gets larger each day.
We, at the height, are ready to decline.	We, now at our largest, can only decrease.
On such a full sea are we now afloat, And we must take the current when it serves Or lose our ventures.	It’s on such a high tide that we’re now floating, and we must take the current when it is offered, or lose our campaign.
Then, with your will, go on.	If that’s what you want, all right.
We’ll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.	We’ll go forward with you and meet them at Philippi.
The deep of night is crept upon our talk, And nature must obey necessity, Which we will niggard with a little rest.	It’s now late at night, and actions must accommodate bodily needs, which we’ll satisfy with only a short rest.
There is no more to say?	That’s all there is to say.
No more.	There’s nothing else.
Good night.	Good night.
Early tomorrow will we rise and hence.	We’ll rise and leave early tomorrow.
Lucius!	Lucius!
Never come such division ’tween our souls.	Let’s pray that we never come into conflict like that again.
Let it not, Brutus.	Let’s not, Brutus.
Is now become a god, and Cassius is A wretched creature and must bend his body If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.	And this is the man who has now become a god, and I’m a wretched creature who must bow down if Caesar so much as carelessly nods my way.
He had a fever when he was in Spain, And when the fit was on him, I did mark How he did shake.	In Spain, Caesar had a fever, and it made him shake.
Tis true, this god did shake!	It’s true, this so-called “god”—he shook.
His coward lips did from their color fly, And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world Did lose his luster.	His cowardly lips turned white, and the same eye whose gaze terrifies the world lost its gleam.
I did hear him groan, Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans Mark him and write his speeches in their books— “Alas,” it cried, “give me some drink, Titinius,” As a sick girl.	I heard him groan—yes, I did—and the same tongue that ordered the Romans to obey him and transcribe his speeches in their books cried, “Give me some water, Titinius,” like a sick girl.
Ye gods, it doth amaze me A man of such a feeble temper should So get the start of the majestic world And bear the palm alone.	It astounds me that such a weak man could beat the whole world and carry the trophy of victory alone.
Another general shout!	More shouting!
I do believe that these applauses are For some new honors that are heaped on Caesar.	I think this applause is for some new honors awarded to Caesar.
Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world Like a Colossus, and we petty men Walk under his huge legs and peep about To find ourselves dishonorable graves.	Why, Caesar straddles the narrow world like a giant, and we petty men walk under his huge legs and look forward only to dying dishonorably, as slaves.
Men at some time are masters of their fates.	Men can be masters of their fate.
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars But in ourselves, that we are underlings.	It is not destiny’s fault, but our own faults, that we’re slaves.
Brutus and Caesar—what should be in that “Caesar”?	Brutus” and “Caesar.” What’s so special about “Caesar”?
Why should that name be sounded more than yours?	Why should that name be proclaimed more than yours?
Write them together, yours is as fair a name.	Write them together—yours is just as good a name.
Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well.	Pronounce them—it is just as nice to say.
Everything is well.	Everything’s fine.
Good night, my lord.	Good night, my lord.
Good night, good brother.	Good night, good brother.
Good night, Lord Brutus.	Good night, Lord Brutus.
Farewell, everyone.	Farewell, everyone.
Give me the gown.	Give me the gown.
Where is thy instrument?	Where’s your lute?
Here in the tent.	Here in the tent.
What, thou speak’st drowsily?	What, are you sleepy?
Call Claudio and some other of my men.	Call Claudio and some of my other men.
I’ll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.	I’ll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.
Varrus and Claudio!	Varrus and Claudio!
Calls my lord?	Did you call, my lord?
I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep.	Sirs, I ask you to sleep in my tent.
It may be I shall raise you by and by On business to my brother Cassius.	I might wake you up in a while to send you on an errand to my brother Cassius.
So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.	If you like, we’ll stand by and wait to do whatever you need.
Look, Lucius, here’s the book I sought for so.	Look, Lucius, here’s the book I was searching for.
I put it in the pocket of my gown.	I put it in the pocket of my nightgown.
I was sure your lordship did not give it me.	I was sure that you hadn’t given it to me.
Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile, And touch thy instrument a strain or two?	Can you stay awake a bit longer and play a few tunes on your lute?
Ay, my lord, an ’t please you.	Yes, my lord, if you would like.
It does, my boy.	I would, my boy.
I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.	I ask too much of you, but you’re always willing.
It is my duty, sir.	It’s my duty, sir.
I should not urge thy duty past thy might.	I shouldn’t make you do more than you’re able.
I know young bloods look for a time of rest.	I know that young men look forward to their rest.
I have slept, my lord, already.	I’ve already slept, my lord.
It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again.	That was good planning, and you’ll sleep some more.
I will not hold thee long.	I won’t keep you very long.
If I do live, I will be good to thee.	If I live through this, I’ll be good to you.
This is a sleepy tune.	This is a sleepy tune.
O murderous slumber, Layst thou thy leaden mace upon my boy That plays thee music?—Gentle knave, good night.	Gentle boy, good night.
I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee.	I won’t trouble you so much as to wake you.
And, good boy, good night.	Good night, good boy.
Let me see, let me see.	Let me see, let me see.
Is not the leaf turned down Where I left reading?	Didn’t I turn down the page where I left off reading?
Here it is, I think.	Here it is, I think.
I think it is the weakness of mine eyes That shapes this monstrous apparition.	I think it’s my bad eyesight that’s making me see this horrible vision.
It comes upon me.—Art thou any thing?	It’s coming toward me.
Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?	Are you a god, an angel, or a devil, that you make my blood turn cold and my hair stand up?
Speak to me what thou art.	Tell me what you are.
Thy evil spirit, Brutus.	I’m your evil spirit, Brutus.
Why comest thou?	Why do you come here?
To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.	To tell you that you’ll see me at Philippi.
Well, then I shall see thee again?	Then I’ll see you again?
Ay, at Philippi.	Yes, at Philippi.
Why, I will see thee at Philippi, then.	Alright, then I’ll see you at Philippi.
Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.	Evil spirit, I want to talk some more.
Claudio!	Claudio!
The strings, my lord, are false.	Claudio!
He thinks he still is at his instrument.	He thinks he’s still playing his instrument.
Lucius, awake.	Lucius, wake up!
My lord?	My lord?
Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?	Were you dreaming, Lucius?
My lord, I do not know that I did cry.	My lord, I don’t think I cried out.
Yes, that thou didst.	Yes, you did.
Didst thou see any thing?	Did you see anything?
Nothing, my lord.	Nothing, my lord.
My lord?	My lord?
My lord?	My lord?
Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?	Why did you cry out in your sleep?
Did we, my lord?	Did we, my lord?
Ay.	Yes.
Saw you anything?	Did you see anything?
No, my lord, I saw nothing.	No, my lord, I didn’t see anything.
Nor I, my lord.	Me neither, my lord.
Go and commend me to my brother Cassius.	Go to my brother Cassius.
Bid him set on his powers betimes before, And we will follow.	Order him to advance his forces first thing, and we’ll follow.
It shall be done, my lord.	Yes, my lord.
Now, Antony, our hopes are answerèd.	Now, Antony, our prayers have been answered.
You said the enemy would not come down But keep the hills and upper regions.	You said the enemy wouldn’t come down but keep to the hills and upper regions.
It proves not so.	It seems not.
Their battles are at hand.	Their forces are nearby.
They mean to warn us at Philippi here, Answering before we do demand of them.	They intend to challenge us here at Philippi, responding to our challenge before we’ve even challenged him.
Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know Wherefore they do it.	I know how they think, and I understand why they’re doing this.
They could be content To visit other places, and come down With fearful bravery, thinking by this face To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage.	They really wish they were somewhere else, but they want to descend on us, looking fierce so we’ll think they’re brave.
But ’tis not so.	But they aren’t.
Prepare you, generals.	Prepare yourselves, generals.
The enemy comes on in gallant show.	The enemy approaches with great display.
Their bloody sign of battle is hung out, And something to be done immediately.	They show their bloody heralds of battle, and something must be done immediately.
Octavius, lead your battle softly on, Upon the left hand of the even field.	Octavius, lead your forces slowly out to the left side of the level field.
Upon the right hand I.	I’ll go to the right side.
Keep thou the left.	You stay on the left.
Why do you cross me in this exigent?	Why are you defying me in this urgent matter?
They stand and would have parley.	They want to talk.
Stand fast, Titinius.	Stay here, Titinius.
We must out and talk.	We have to go out and talk to them.
Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?	Mark Antony, should we give the signal to attack?
No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.	No, Octavius Caesar, we’ll respond to their charge.
Make forth.	Go forward.
The generals would have some words.	The generals want to speak with us.
Words before blows.	Words before fighting.
Is it so, countrymen?	Is that how it is, countrymen?
Not that we love words better, as you do.	Not that we love words more than fighting, like you do.
Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.	Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.
In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words.	Brutus, you give a nice speech along with your evil strokes.
But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees And leave them honeyless.	But your words are as sweet as honey—you’ve stolen from the bees and left them with nothing.
Not stingless too?	I took their stings too, wouldn’t you say?
Villains, you did not so when your vile daggers Hacked one another in the sides of Caesar.	Villains, you didn’t do even that much when your vile daggers struck each other as they hacked up Caesar’s sides.
Flatterers?—Now, Brutus, thank yourself.	Now, Brutus, you have only yourself to thank.
When think you that the sword goes up again?	Come, come, let’s remember why we’re here.
Never, till Caesar’s three and thirty wounds Be well avenged, or till another Caesar Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.	If arguing makes us sweat, the real trial will turn that water to blood.
Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands Unless thou bring’st them with thee.	Caesar, you’re not going to be killed by a traitor—unless you kill yourself..
So I hope.	I hope you’re right.
I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.	I wasn’t born to die on your sword.
O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain, Young man, thou couldst not die more honorable.	If you were the noblest of your family, young man, you couldn’t die more honorably.
A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honor, Joined with a masker and a reveler!	An annoying schoolboy, unworthy of such an honor, joined by a masquerader and a partier!
Old Cassius still.	Still the same old Cassius!
If you dare fight today, come to the field.	If you dare to fight today, come to the field.
If not, when you have stomachs.	If not, come when you have the courage.
Why, now, blow wind, swell billow, and swim bark!	Now let the wind blow, waves swell, and ships sink!
The storm is up and all is on the hazard.	The storm has begun and everything is at stake.
Messala!	Messala!
Messala, This is my birthday, as this very day Was Cassius born.	Messala, today is my birthday—I was born on this very day.
Give me thy hand, Messala.	Give me your hand, Messala.
Be thou my witness that against my will, As Pompey was, am I compelled to set Upon one battle all our liberties.	You’ll be my witness that I’ve been forced, as Pompey was, to wager all of our freedoms on one battle.
You know that I held Epicurus strong And his opinion.	You know that I used to believe in Epicurus and his disregard for omens.
Now I change my mind, And partly credit things that do presage.	I’ve changed my mind now and partly believe in omens.
Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perched, Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands, Who to Philippi here consorted us.	Traveling from Sardis, two mighty eagles fell on our front flag and perched there, eating from the hands of the soldiers who’d accompanied us to Philippi.
This morning are they fled away and gone, And in their steads do ravens, crows, and kites Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us As we were sickly prey.	This morning, they’ve flown away and in their place are ravens, crows, and kites, flying over our heads and looking down on us, as though we were sickly prey.
Their shadows seem A canopy most fatal, under which Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.	Their shadows are like a deadly canopy, under which our army lies, ready to die.
Believe not so.	Don’t believe in this.
I but believe it partly, For I am fresh of spirit and resolved To meet all perils very constantly.	I only partly believe it, for I’m enthusiastic and resolved to meet all dangers without wavering.
Now, most noble Brutus, The gods today stand friendly that we may, Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age.	Now, most noble Brutus, the gods are friendly with us today so that we, who want peace, can live on to old age!
But since the affairs of men rest still incertain, Let’s reason with the worst that may befall.	But since the affairs of men are always uncertain, let’s think about the worst that may happen.
If we do lose this battle, then is this The very last time we shall speak together.	If we lose this battle, this is the last time we’ll speak to each other.
What are you then determinèd to do?	If we lose, what do you plan to do?
Brutus” will start a spirit as soon as “Caesar.” Now in the names of all the gods at once, Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed That he is grown so great?	Cast spells with them, and “Brutus” will call up a ghost as well as “Caesar.” Now, in the name of all the gods, I ask you what food does Caesar eat that has made him grow so great?
Age, thou art shamed!	Our era should be ashamed!
Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!	Rome has lost the ability to raise noble men!
When went there by an age, since the great flood, But it was famed with more than with one man?	When was there ever an age, since the beginning of time, that didn’t feature more than one famous man?
When could they say till now, that talked of Rome, That her wide walks encompassed but one man?	Until now, no one could say that only one man mattered in all of vast Rome.
Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough, When there is in it but one only man.	Now, though, in all of Rome, there’s room for only one man.
Oh, you and I have heard our fathers say, There was a Brutus once that would have brooked Th' eternal devil to keep his state in Rome As easily as a king.	You and I have heard our fathers talk of another Brutus—your ancestor—who would’ve let the devil himself reign in his Roman Republic before he let a king rule.
That you do love me, I am nothing jealous.	I have no doubt that you love me.
What you would work me to, I have some aim.	I’m beginning to understand what you want me to do.
How I have thought of this and of these times I shall recount hereafter.	What I think about this, and about what’s happening here in Rome, I’ll tell you later.
For this present, I would not, so with love I might entreat you, Be any further moved.	For now, don’t try to persuade me anymore—I ask you as a friend.
What you have said I will consider, what you have to say I will with patience hear, and find a time Both meet to hear and answer such high things.	I’ll think over what you’ve said, I’ll listen patiently to whatever else you have to say, and I’ll find a good time for us to discuss further such weighty matters.
Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this: Brutus had rather be a villager Than to repute himself a son of Rome Under these hard conditions as this time Is like to lay upon us.	Until then, my noble friend, think about this: I’d rather be a poor villager than call myself a citizen of Rome under the hard conditions that this time is likely to put us through.
I am glad that my weak words Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.	I’m glad that my weak words have provoked even this small show of protest from you.
Then if we lose this battle You are contented to be led in triumph Thorough the streets of Rome?	Then if we lose this battle, you’ll be willing to be led in chains through the streets of Rome?
No, Cassius, no.	No, Cassius, no.
Think not, thou noble Roman, That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome.	Don’t imagine that I’ll ever allow myself to return to Rome in chains.
He bears too great a mind.	My mind is too great for that.
Therefore our everlasting farewell take.	Therefore, accept my everlasting farewell.
Forever and forever farewell, Cassius.	Forever and forever, farewell, Cassius!
If we do meet again, why, we shall smile.	If we meet again, then we’ll smile.
If not, why then this parting was well made.	If not, then this parting was well done.
Forever and forever farewell, Brutus.	Forever and forever, farewell, Brutus!
If we do meet again, we’ll smile indeed.	If we meet again, then we’ll smile indeed.
If not, ’tis true this parting was well made.	If not, it’s true, this parting was well done.
Why then, lead on.	Well, lead on.
Oh, that a man might know The end of this day’s business ere it come!	Oh, I wish I could know what will happen today before it happens!
But it sufficeth that the day will end, And then the end is known.—Come, ho!	But it’s enough to know that the day will end, and then the end will be known.
Away!	Let’s go!
Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills Unto the legions on the other side.	Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these dispatches to our forces on the other side.
Let them set on at once, for I perceive But cold demeanor in Octavius' wing, And sudden push gives them the overthrow.	They should advance immediately, because I sense Octavius’s side is a bit fainthearted right now, and a sudden push would overthrow him.
Ride, ride, Messala.	Ride, ride, Messala.
Myself have to mine own turned enemy.	I’ve become an enemy to my own soldiers!
O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early, Who, having some advantage on Octavius, Took it too eagerly.	Oh, Cassius, Brutus gave the orders too soon.
Fly further off, my lord, fly further off.	Retreat further, my lord, retreat further.
Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord.	Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord.
Fly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.	Therefore you must run, noble Cassius.
Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?	Are those my tents on fire?
They are, my lord.	They are, my lord.
Titinius, if thou lovest me, Mount thou my horse, and hide thy spurs in him Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops And here again, that I may rest assured Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.	Titinius, if you love me, get on your horse and spur him on until he’s brought you to those troops and back again, so that I can find out whether those troops are friends or enemies.
I will be here again, even with a thought.	I’ll be back quicker than you can think a thought.
Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill.	Go, Pindarus, climb a little higher on this hill.
My sight was ever thick.	My eyesight has always been bad.
Regard Titinius, And tell me what thou notest about the field.	Watch Titinius and tell me what you see in the field.
This day I breathed first.	Today was the day I breathed my first breath.
Time is come round, And where I did begin, there shall I end.	Time has come round, and I’ll end where I began.
My life is run his compass.	My life has run its circle.
What news?	What news?
And, hark!	And listen!
They shout for joy.	They shout for joy.
Come down, behold no more.	Come down, look no more.
Oh, coward that I am, to live so long To see my best friend ta'en before my face!	Oh, I’m such a coward for living long enough to see my best friend taken before my eyes!
Come hither, sirrah.	Come here, boy.
Come now, keep thine oath.	Come now, keep your oath.
Caesar, thou art revenged, Even with the sword that killed thee.	Caesar, you are revenged with the very same sword that killed you.
So I am free.	So I’m free.
Yet would not so have been, Durst I have done my will.	But I didn’t want to be free like this.
O Cassius, Far from this country Pindarus shall run, Where never Roman shall take note of him.	Oh, Cassius, I’ll run far from this country to where no Romans can find me.
It is but change, Titinius, for Octavius Is overthrown by noble Brutus' power, As Cassius' legions are by Antony.	The armies have merely changed places, Titinius, because Octavius has been overthrown by noble Brutus’s forces at the very moment that Antony overthrew Cassius’s legions.
These tidings will well comfort Cassius.	This news will comfort Cassius.
Where did you leave him?	Where did you leave him?
All disconsolate, With Pindarus his bondman on this hill.	On this hill and in despair, with his slave Pindarus.
Is not that he that lies upon the ground?	Isn’t that him on the ground?
He lies not like the living.	He doesn’t seem to be alive.
O my heart!	Oh, my heart!
Is not that he?	Isn’t that him?
What, Pindarus!	Pindarus!
Where art thou, Pindarus?	Where are you, Pindarus?
Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet The noble Brutus, thrusting this report Into his ears.	Look for him, Titinius, while I go to meet the noble Brutus and force him to hear this news.
I may say “thrusting” it, For piercing steel and darts envenomèd Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus As tidings of this sight.	I say “force” because Brutus would rather I stuck sharp blades and poisoned arrows in his ears than fill them with this.
Hie you, Messala, And I will seek for Pindarus the while.	Hurry, Messala, and I’ll look for Pindarus in the meantime.
Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?	Why did you send me out, brave Cassius?
Did I not meet thy friends?	Didn’t I meet up with your allies?
And did not they Put on my brows this wreath of victory And bid me give it thee?	And didn’t they place the wreath of victory on my brow and order me to give it to you?
Didst thou not hear their shouts?	Didn’t you hear their shouts?
Alas, thou hast misconstrued everything!	Alas, you misunderstood everything!
But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow.	But let me place this wreath on your head.
Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I Will do his bidding.	Your Brutus ordered me to give it to you, and I’ll do what he says.
Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?	Where is his body, Messala?
Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.	Over there, where Titinius mourns it.
Titinius' face is upward.	Titinius is lying face-up.
He is slain.	He’s been killed.
O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!	Oh, Julius Caesar, you are still powerful.
Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords In our own proper entrails.	Your ghost walks the earth and turns our swords toward our own stomachs.
Are yet two Romans living such as these?	Could you have found two Romans as good as these two?
The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!	Good-bye to you, the last of all the Romans.
I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.	I will find the time to cry for you, Cassius, I’ll find the time.
Come, therefore, and to Thasos send his body.	Come, then, and send his body to Thasos.
Let us to the field.	Let’s proceed to the field.
Labio and Flavio, set our battles on.	Labio and Flavio, push our armies onward.
Tis three o'clock, and, Romans, yet ere night We shall try fortune in a second fight.	It is three o'clock, and, Romans, before night, we will try our luck in a second battle.
What bastard doth not?	Who is so low that he wouldn’t?
Who will go with me?	Who will advance with me?
I will proclaim my name about the field.	I will proclaim my name around the field.
I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!	I am the son of Marcus Cato!
A foe to tyrants, and my country’s friend.	An enemy to tyrants and a friend to my country.
I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!	I am the son of Marcus Cato!
And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I!	And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus.
Brutus, my country’s friend.	Brutus, my country’s friend.
Know me for Brutus!	Know that I am Brutus!
O young and noble Cato, art thou down?	Oh, young and noble Cato, have you been slain?
Only I yield to die.	I’d rather die.
There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight.	Here is some money for you to kill me immediately.
Kill Brutus, and be honored in his death.	Kill Brutus and be honored by the killing.
We must not.	We must not.
A noble prisoner!	He is a noble prisoner!
Room, ho!	Make room!
Tell Antony Brutus is ta'en.	Tell Antony that Brutus has been taken.
I’ll tell the news.	I’ll tell him the news.
Where is he?	Where is he?
Safe, Antony.	He’s safe, Antony.
I dare assure thee that no enemy Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus.	I can assure you that no enemy will ever take the noble Brutus alive.
The gods defend him from so great a shame!	The gods protect him from so great a shame!
The games are done and Caesar is returning.	The games are done and Caesar is returning.
As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve, And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you What hath proceeded worthy note today.	As they pass by, grab Casca by the sleeve, and he’ll tell you if anything important happened today—in his usual sour way.
I will do so.	I’ll do so.
But, look you, Cassius, The angry spot doth glow on Caesar’s brow, And all the rest look like a chidden train.	But look, Cassius, Caesar looks angry and everyone else looks as if they’ve been scolded.
Calphurnia’s cheek is pale, and Cicero Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes As we have seen him in the Capitol Being crossed in conference by some senators.	Calphurnia’s face is pale, and Cicero’s eyes are as red and fiery as they get when senators are arguing with him at the Capitol.
Casca will tell us what the matter is.	Casca will tell us what’s the matter.
Antonio.	Antonio!
Caesar.	Caesar?
Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.	Come, last of my friends, rest on this rock.
Statilius showed the torchlight but, my lord, He came not back.	Statilius waved the torchlight at us, but he hasn’t come back.
He is or ta'en or slain.	He’s been captured or killed.
Sit thee down, Clitus.	Sit down, Clitus.
Hark thee, Clitus.	Listen, Clitus.
What, I, my lord?	Who, me, my lord?
No, not for all the world.	No, not for all the world.
Peace then!	Silence, then!
No words.	Don’t give it away.
I’ll rather kill myself.	I’d rather kill myself.
Hark thee, Dardanius.	Listen, Dardanius.
Shall I do such a deed?	Would I dare do something like that?
O Dardanius!	Oh Dardanius!
O Clitus!	Oh Clitus!
Come hither, good Volumnius.	Come here, good Volumnius.
List a word.	Listen a minute.
What says my lord?	What is it, my lord?
At Sardis once, And this last night here in Philippi fields.	Once at Sardis and once last night, here in Philippi fields.
I know my hour is come.	I know that my hour has come.
Not so, my lord.	No, it hasn’t, my lord.
Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.	No, I’m sure it has, Volumnius.
Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes.	You see how the world goes, Volumnius.
Our enemies have beat us to the pit.	Our enemies have driven us to the edge of the grave.
It is more worthy to leap in ourselves Than tarry till they push us.	It’s nobler to leap in ourselves than dawdle until they push us.
Good Volumnius, Thou know’st that we two went to school together.	Good Volumnius, you know that we went to school together.
Even for that our love of old, I prithee, Hold thou my sword hilts, whilst I run on it.	For the sake of our old friendship, I ask you, hold my sword handle while I run on it.
That’s not an office for a friend, my lord.	That’s not a job for a friend, my lord.
Fly, fly, my lord.	Run, run, my lord.
There is no tarrying here.	We can’t wait here.
Farewell to you.—And you.—And you, Volumnius.	Farewell to you, and you, and you, Volumnius.
Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep.	Strato, you’ve slept this whole time.
I shall have glory by this losing day More than Octavius and Mark Antony By this vile conquest shall attain unto.	I’ll have glory in this losing day—more than Octavius and Mark Antony will gain by their foul conquest.
So fare you well at once, for Brutus' tongue Hath almost ended his life’s history.	So farewell, all, for my tongue has almost finished with its life.
Night hangs upon mine eyes.	I can’t see ahead of me.
My bones would rest, That have but labored to attain this hour.	My bones want to rest after helping me up to this hour.
Fly, my lord, fly.	Run, my lord, run.
Hence.	Go on!
I will follow.	I’ll follow.
I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord.	I beg you, Strato, stay by me.
Thou art a fellow of a good respect.	You’re a man with a good reputation.
Thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it.	Your life has had honor in it.
Hold then my sword and turn away thy face While I do run upon it.	Then, hold my sword and turn your face away while I run on it.
Wilt thou, Strato?	Will you, Strato?
Give me your hand first.	Give me your hand, first.
Farewell, good Strato.	Farewell, good Strato.
What man is that?	What man is that?
Free from the bondage you are in, Messala.	Free from the bondage you are in, Messala.
All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.	I’ll take all who served Brutus into my service.
Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?	You, will you join with me?
Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.	Yes, if Messala recommends me to you.
Do so, good Messala.	Do so, good Messala.
How died my master, Strato?	How did my master die, Strato?
I held the sword and he did run on it.	I held the sword and he ran on it.
Octavius, then take him to follow thee, That did the latest service to my master.	Then take this man into your service, Octavius, for he did the final service to my master.
This was the noblest Roman of them all.	This was the noblest Roman of them all.
All the conspirators save only he Did that they did in envy of great Caesar.	All the rest of the conspirators acted out of jealousy of great Caesar.
He only in a general honest thought And common good to all, made one of them.	Only he acted from honesty and for the general good.
His life was gentle, and the elements So mixed in him that Nature might stand up And say to all the world, “This was a man.” According to his virtue let us use him, With all respect and rites of burial.	His life was gentle, and the elements mixed so well in him that Nature might stand up and say to all the world, “This was a man.” Let’s treat him according to his virtue, with all the respect and rituals of burial.
Within my tent his bones tonight shall lie Most like a soldier, ordered honorably.	His body will lie in my tent tonight, with the honorable observance that suits a soldier.
So call the field to rest, and let’s away To part the glories of this happy day.	So order the armies to rest, and let’s go home to share the glories of this happy day.
Ay, Casca.	Yes, Casca.
Tell us what hath chanced today That Caesar looks so sad.	Tell us what happened today that put Caesar in such a serious mood.
Why, you were with him, were you not?	But you were with him, weren’t you?
I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.	If I were, I wouldn’t need to ask you what happened.
Why, there was a crown offered him; and, being offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand, thus; and then the people fell a-shouting.	A crown was offered to him, and he pushed it away with the back of his hand, like this—and then the people started shouting.
What was the second noise for?	What was the second noise for?
Why, for that too.	The same thing.
They shouted thrice.	They shouted three times.
What was the last cry for?	What was the last cry for?
Why, for that too.	For the same thing.
Was the crown offered him thrice?	The crown was offered to him three times?
Ay, marry, was ’t, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler than other, and at every putting-by mine honest neighbors shouted.	Yes, indeed, it was, and he pushed it away three times, each time more gently than the last; and at each refusal my countrymen shouted.
Who offered him the crown?	Who offered him the crown?
Why, Antony.	Antony.
Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.	Tell us how it happened, noble Casca.
I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it.	I can’t explain it.
I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown (yet ’twas not a crown neither, ’twas one of these coronets) and, as I told you, he put it by once—but, for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it.	I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown—though it wasn’t a real crown, just a small circlet—and, as I told you, he refused it once—though in my opinion he would’ve liked to have it.
Then he offered it to him again, then he put it by again—but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it.	Then Antony offered it to him again, and he refused it again (though, in my opinion, he was reluctant to take his hand off it).
And then he offered it the third time.	Then Antony offered it the third time.
And for mine own part, I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air.	As for myself, I didn’t dare laugh, for fear of opening my lips and inhaling the stinking air.
But soft, I pray you.	But wait a minute, please.
What, did Caesar swoon?	Did you say Caesar fainted?
He fell down in the marketplace, and foamed at mouth, and was speechless.	He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at the mouth and was speechless.
Tis very like.	That’s very likely.
He hath the falling sickness.	He has epilepsy, a disease where you fall down.
No, Caesar hath it not.	No, Caesar doesn’t have epilepsy.
But you and I And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.	You and I, and honest Casca, we have epilepsy—we’ve fallen.
I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar fell down.	I don’t know what you mean by that, but I’m sure Caesar fell down.
What said he when he came unto himself?	What did he say when he regained consciousness?
Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown, he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut.	Indeed, before he fell down, when he realized the commoners were glad he refused the crown, he pulled open his robe and offered them his throat to cut.
An I had been a man of any occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word, I would I might go to hell among the rogues.	If I’d been a common laborer and hadn’t taken him up on his offer, to hell with me.
And so he fell.	And so he fainted.
When he came to himself again, he said, if he had done or said anything amiss, he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity.	When he regained consciousness again, he said that if he’d done or said anything wrong, he wanted them to know that it was all because of his sickness.
Three or four wenches where I stood cried, “Alas, good soul!” and forgave him with all their hearts.	Three or four women near me cried, “Alas, good soul!” and forgave him with all their hearts.
If Caesar had stabbed their mothers they would have done no less.	But never mind them—if Caesar had stabbed their mothers, they would’ve forgiven him.
And after that he came thus sad away?	And after that he came back here looking so serious?
Ay.	Yes.
Hence!	Get out of here!
Home, you idle creatures get you home!	Go home, you lazy men.
Is this a holiday?	What, is today a holiday?
Why, sir, a carpenter.	I’m a carpenter, sir.
Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?	Where are your leather apron and your ruler?
What dost thou with thy best apparel on?	What are you doing, wearing your best clothes?
Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but, as you would say, a cobbler.	And you, sir, what’s  Well, compared to a fine workman, you might call me a mere cobbler.
But what trade art thou?	But what’s your trade?
Answer me directly.	Answer me straightforwardly.
A trade, sir, that I hope I may use with a safe conscience, which is, indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.	It is a trade, sir, that I practice with a clear conscience.
What trade, thou knave?	What trade, boy?
Thou naughty knave, what trade?	You insolent rascal, what trade?
Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me.	Sir, please, don’t be angry.
Yet, if you be out, sir, I can mend you.	But if your soles are worn out, I can mend you.
What mean’st thou by that?	What do you mean by that?
Mend” me, thou saucy fellow?	Mend” me, you impertinent fellow?
Did Cicero say anything?	Did Cicero say anything?
Ay, he spoke Greek.	Yes, he said something in Greek.
To what effect?	What did he say?
Nay, an I tell you that, I’ll ne'er look you i' th' face again.	If I told you I understood Greek, I’d be lying.
But those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads.	But those who understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads.
But, for mine own part, it was Greek to me.	As for myself, it was Greek to me.
I could tell you more news too.	I have more news too.
Murellus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs off Caesar’s images, are put to silence.	Murellus and Flavius have been punished for pulling scarves off statues of Caesar.
Fare you well.	There you go.
There was more foolery yet, if I could remember it.	There was even more foolishness, if I could only remember it.
Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?	Will you have dinner with me tonight, Casca?
No, I am promised forth.	No, I have a commitment.
Will you dine with me tomorrow?	Will you dine with me tomorrow?
Ay, if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner worth the eating.	Yes, if I’m still alive, and you’re still sane, and your dinner is worth eating.
Good.	Good.
I will expect you.	I’ll expect you.
Do so.	Do so.
Farewell both.	Farewell to you both.
What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!	What a stupid man he’s become!
He was quick mettle when he went to school.	He was so sharp when he was in school.
So is he now in execution Of any bold or noble enterprise, However he puts on this tardy form.	He’s still sharp when it comes to carrying out a bold or noble enterprise, though he puts on this show of stupidity.
This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit, Which gives men stomach to digest his words With better appetite.	He speaks roughly, but what he says is smart, and his roughness makes other people enjoy listening to him.
And so it is.	You’re right, that’s how it is.
For this time I will leave you.	I’ll leave you for now.
Tomorrow, if you please to speak with me, I will come home to you.	If you’d like to talk tomorrow, I’ll come to your home.
Or, if you will, Come home to me, and I will wait for you.	Or, if you don’t mind, come to my home, and I’ll wait for you.
I will do so.	I’ll do so.
Till then, think of the world.	Until then, think about the well-being of Rome.
Well, Brutus, thou art noble.	Well, Brutus, you’re noble.
Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus.	Caesar resents me, but he loves Brutus.
If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius, He should not humor me.	If I were Brutus now and Brutus were me, I wouldn’t have let him influence me.
I will this night, In several hands, in at his windows throw, As if they came from several citizens, Writings all tending to the great opinion That Rome holds of his name, wherein obscurely Caesar’s ambition shall be glancèd at.	Tonight I’ll throw through his window a few letters in different handwriting—as if they came from several citizens—all testifying to the great respect Romans have for Brutus, and all alluding to Caesar’s unseemly ambition.
Brought you Caesar home?	Did you accompany Caesar home?
O Cicero, I have seen tempests when the scolding winds Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen Th' ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam To be exalted with the threatening clouds, But never till tonight, never till now, Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.	Cicero, I’ve seen storms in which the angry winds split old oak trees, and I’ve seen the ocean swell, rage, and foam, as if it wanted to reach the storm clouds, but never before tonight, never until now, have I experienced a storm that drops fire.
Either there is a civil strife in heaven, Or else the world, too saucy with the gods, Incenses them to send destruction.	Either there are wars in heaven, or else the world, too insolent toward the gods, provokes them to send destruction.
Besides—I ha' not since put up my sword— Against the Capitol I met a lion, Who glared upon me and went surly by, Without annoying me.	Also—I’ve kept my sword unsheathed since I saw this—in front of the Capitol I met a lion who looked at me and strutted by without bothering to attack me.
And there were drawn Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women, Transformèd with their fear, who swore they saw Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.	And there were a hundred spooked women huddled together in fear who swore they saw men on fire walk up and down the streets.
And yesterday the bird of night did sit Even at noon-day upon the marketplace, Hooting and shrieking.	And yesterday the night owl sat hooting and shrieking in the marketplace at noon.
When these prodigies Do so conjointly meet, let not men say, “These are their reasons.	When all these extraordinary things happen at once, we shouldn’t say, “These happenings can be explained rationally.
They are natural.” For I believe they are portentous things Unto the climate that they point upon.	They’re natural enough.” I think these things are omens of things to come in our country.
Indeed, it is a strange-disposèd time.	Indeed, it’s a strange time.
But men may construe things after their fashion, Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.	But men tend to interpret things however suits them and totally miss the actual meaning of the things themselves.
Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow?	Is Caesar visiting the Capitol tomorrow?
He doth, for he did bid Antonius Send word to you he would be there tomorrow.	He is, because he told Antonius to tell you he’d be there tomorrow.
Good night then, Casca.	Good night then, Casca.
This disturbèd sky Is not to walk in.	This bad weather isn’t good to walk around in.
A Roman.	A Roman.
Casca, by your voice.	It’s Casca—I know your voice.
Your ear is good.	Your ear is good.
Cassius, what night is this!	Cassius, what a night this is!
A very pleasing night to honest men.	It’s a very pleasing night to honest men.
Who ever knew the heavens menace so?	Who ever saw the heavens threaten like this?
Those that have known the earth so full of faults.	Those who have known how bad things are here on earth.
For my part, I have walked about the streets, Submitting me unto the perilous night, And, thus unbracèd, Casca, as you see, Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone.	I have walked around the streets, exposing myself to the perilous night, unbuttoned like this, as you see, Casca, baring my chest to the thunderbolt.
And when the cross blue lightning seemed to open The breast of heaven, I did present myself Even in the aim and very flash of it.	When the forked blue lightning seemed to break open the sky, I put myself right where I thought it would hit.
But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?	But why did you tempt the heavens like that?
It is the part of men to fear and tremble When the most mighty gods by tokens send Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.	Mankind’s role is to fear and tremble when the almighty gods send warning signals.
You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life That should be in a Roman you do want, Or else you use not.	You’re acting stupid, Casca, and you lack the quick wits that a Roman should have—or else you don’t use them.
You look pale, and gaze, And put on fear, and cast yourself in wonder To see the strange impatience of the heavens.	You go pale, you stare, and you act in awe of the strange disturbance in the heavens.
A man no mightier than thyself or me In personal action, yet prodigious grown, And fearful as these strange eruptions are.	A man no mightier than you or I in ability, yet grown as huge and frightening as tonight’s strange happenings.
Let it be who it is.	Let it be who it is.
Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.	Our tolerance for slavery and oppression shows us to be weak, like women.
Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow Mean to establish Caesar as a king, And he shall wear his crown by sea and land In every place save here in Italy.	Indeed, they say that the senators plan to establish Caesar as a king tomorrow, and he’ll wear his crown at sea and on land everywhere except here in Italy.
I know where I will wear this dagger then.	I know where I’ll wear this dagger, then.
Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius.	I’ll kill myself to save myself from slavery.
Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong.	In suicide, gods make the weak strong.
Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat.	In suicide, gods allow tyrants to be defeated.
Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass, Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron Can be retentive to the strength of spirit.	No stony tower, no brass walls, no airless dungeon, no iron chains can contain a strong mind.
But life, being weary of these worldly bars, Never lacks power to dismiss itself.	But if a man becomes weary of these obstacles, he can always kill himself.
If I know this, know all the world besides, That part of tyranny that I do bear I can shake off at pleasure.	Let everyone beware: I can shake off the tyranny that now oppresses me whenever I choose.
So can I.	So can I.
So every bondman in his own hand bears The power to cancel his captivity.	In fact, every imprisoned man holds in his own hand the tool to free himself.
And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?	How can Caesar be a tyrant then?
Poor man!	Poor man!
I know he would not be a wolf But that he sees the Romans are but sheep.	I know he wouldn’t be a wolf if the Romans didn’t act like sheep.
He were no lion were not Romans hinds.	He couldn’t be a lion if the Romans weren’t such easy prey.
Those that with haste will make a mighty fire Begin it with weak straws.	People who want to start a big fire quickly start with little twigs.
But, O grief, Where hast thou led me?	But, oh no!
Then I know My answer must be made.	What have I said in my grief?
You speak to Casca, and to such a man That is no fleering telltale.	Say no more.
Hold, my hand.	Shake my hand.
Be factious for redress of all these griefs, And I will set this foot of mine as far As who goes farthest.	If you’re joining together to right these wrongs, I’ll go as far as any one of you.
There’s a bargain made.	That’s a deal.
Now know you, Casca, I have moved already Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans To undergo with me an enterprise Of honorable-dangerous consequence.	Now let me tell you, Casca, I have already convinced some of the noblest Romans to join me in an honorable but dangerous mission.
And I do know by this they stay for me In Pompey’s porch.	And I know that by now they’re waiting for me on the porch outside Pompey’s theater.
Tis Cinna.	It’s Cinna.
I do know him by his gait.	I recognize his walk.
To find out you.	To find you.
Who’s that?	Who’s that?
Metellus Cimber?	Metellus Cimber?
No, it is Casca, one incorporate To our attempts.	No, it’s Casca, someone who’s going to work with us.
Am I not stayed for, Cinna?	Aren’t the others waiting for me, Cinna?
I am glad on ’t.	I’m glad Casca is with us.
What a fearful night is this!	What a fearful night this is!
There’s two or three of us have seen strange sights.	Two or three of us have seen strange things.
Am I not stayed for?	Are the others waiting?
Tell me.	Tell me.
Yes, you are.	Yes, they are.
O Cassius, if you could But win the noble Brutus to our party— Be you content.	Oh, Cassius, if you could only convince Brutus to join us— Don’t worry.
Good Cinna, take this paper, And look you lay it in the praetor’s chair Where Brutus may but find it.	Good Cinna, take this paper and be sure to lay it in the judge’s chair where Brutus sits, so he’ll find it.
All this done, Repair to Pompey’s porch, where you shall find us.	When you’ve finished all this, return to the porch of Pompey’s theater, where you’ll find us.
Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?	Are Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?
All but Metellus Cimber, and he’s gone To seek you at your house.	Everyone’s there except Metellus Cimber, and he’s gone to look for you at your house.
Well, I will hie, And so bestow these papers as you bade me.	Well, I’ll hurry and put these papers where you told me.
That done, repair to Pompey’s theatre.	When you’ve finished, go back to Pompey’s theater.
Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day See Brutus at his house.	Come on, Casca, you and I will go see Brutus at his house before sunrise.
Him and his worth and our great need of him You have right well conceited.	Yes, you’re absolutely right about how worthy Brutus is and how much we need him.
Let us go, For it is after midnight, and ere day We will awake him and be sure of him.	Let’s go, because it’s already after midnight, and we want him on our side before daylight.
Awake, I say!	Wake up, I say!
What, Lucius!	Lucius!
Called you, my lord?	Did you call me, my lord?
Get me a taper in my study, Lucius.	Put a candle in my study, Lucius.
When it is lighted, come and call me here.	Call me when it’s lit.
I will, my lord.	I will, my lord.
It must be by his death, and for my part I know no personal cause to spurn at him But for the general.	I have no personal reason to strike at him—only the best interest of the people.
He would be crowned.	He wants to be crowned.
How that might change his nature, there’s the question.	The question is, how would being king change him?
It is the bright day that brings forth the adder And that craves wary walking.	Evil can come from good, just as poisonous snakes tend to come out into the open on bright sunny days—which means we have to walk carefully.
Crown him that, And then I grant we put a sting in him That at his will he may do danger with.	If we crown him, I have to admit we’d be giving him the power to do damage.
Why, sir, cobble you.	Cobble you, sir.
Thou art a cobbler, art thou?	You’re a cobbler, are you?
Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl.	Sir, I make my living using an awl.
I meddle with no tradesman’s matters nor women’s matters, but withal I am indeed, sir, a surgeon to old shoes.	I’m a surgeon to old shoes.
When they are in great danger, I recover them.	When they’re endangered, I save them.
As proper men as ever trod upon neat’s leather have gone upon my handiwork.	The noblest men who ever walked on leather have walked on my handiwork.
But wherefore art not in thy shop today?	But why aren’t you in your shop today?
Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?	Why are you leading these men through the streets?
Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes to get myself into more work.	Well, to wear out their shoes and get myself more work.
Wherefore rejoice?	Why would you celebrate it?
What conquest brings he home?	What victory does he bring home?
What tributaries follow him to Rome To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels?	What foreign lands has he conquered and captive foreigners chained to his chariot wheels?
Th' abuse of greatness is when it disjoins Remorse from power.	Rulers abuse their power when they separate it from compassion.
So Caesar may.	Caesar might act like that.
Then, lest he may, prevent.	Therefore, in case he does, we must hold him back.
And since the quarrel Will bear no color for the thing he is, Fashion it thus: that what he is, augmented, Would run to these and these extremities.	And since our quarrel is with his future behavior, not what he does now, I must frame the argument like this: if his position is furthered, his character will fulfill these predictions.
The taper burneth in your closet, sir.	The candle is burning in your study, sir.
Searching the window for a flint, I found This paper, thus sealed up, and I am sure It did not lie there when I went to bed.	While I was looking for a flint to light it, I found this paper on the window, sealed up like this, and I’m sure it wasn’t there when I went to bed.
Get you to bed again.	Go back to bed.
It is not day.	It isn’t daybreak yet.
Is not tomorrow, boy, the ides of March?	Is tomorrow the 15th of March, boy?
I know not, sir.	I don’t know, sir.
Look in the calendar and bring me word.	Check the calendar and come tell me.
I will, sir.	I will, sir.
Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.	Sir, fifteen days of March have gone by.
Tis good.	Good.
Go to the gate.	Go to the gate.
Somebody knocks.	Somebody’s knocking.
Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar, I have not slept.	I haven’t slept since Cassius first began to turn me against Caesar.
Is he alone?	Is he alone?
Do you know them?	Do you know them?
Let 'em enter.	Let them in.
O conspiracy, Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night When evils are most free?	Oh, conspiracy, are you ashamed to show your face even at night, when evil things are most free?
O, then by day Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough To mask thy monstrous visage?	If so, when it’s day, where are you going to find a cave dark enough to hide your monstrous face?
Hide it in smiles and affability.	Instead, hide your true face behind smiles and friendliness.
I think we are too bold upon your rest.	I’m afraid we’re intruding too boldly on your sleep time.
Good morrow, Brutus.	Good morning, Brutus.
Do we trouble you?	Are we bothering you?
I have been up this hour, awake all night.	I’ve been up all night.
Know I these men that come along with you?	Do I know these men who are with you?
This is Trebonius.	This is Trebonius.
He is welcome hither.	He’s welcome here.
This, Decius Brutus.	This is Decius Brutus.
He is welcome too.	He’s welcome too.
This, Casca.	This is Casca.
This, Cinna.	This is Cinna.
And this, Metellus Cimber.	And this is Metellus Cimber.
They are all welcome.	They’re all welcome.
What watchful cares do interpose themselves Betwixt your eyes and night?	What worries have kept you awake tonight?
Shall I entreat a word?	Can I have a word with you?
Here lies the east.	Here’s the east.
Doth not the day break here?	Won’t the dawn come from here?
No.	No.
You shall confess that you are both deceived.	You’re both wrong.
And let us swear our resolution.	And let us swear to our resolution.
No, not an oath.	No, let’s not swear an oath.
So let high-sighted tyranny range on Till each man drop by lottery.	Then we can let this ambitious tyrant continue unchallenged until each of us is killed at his whim.
But if these— As I am sure they do—bear fire enough To kindle cowards and to steel with valor The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen, What need we any spur but our own cause To prick us to redress?	But if we have reasons that are strong enough to ignite cowards into action and to make weak women brave—and I think we do—then, countrymen, what else could we possibly need to spur us to action?
What other bond Than secret Romans that have spoke the word And will not palter?	What bond do we need other than that of discreet Romans who have said what they’re going to do and won’t back down?
And what other oath Than honesty to honesty engaged, That this shall be, or we will fall for it?	And what oath do we need other than that we honest men have told each other that this will happen or we will die trying?
Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous, Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls That welcome wrongs.	Swearing is for priests, cowards, overly cautious men, feeble old people, and those long-suffering weaklings who welcome abuse.
Unto bad causes swear Such creatures as men doubt.	Only men whom you wouldn’t trust anyway would swear oaths, and for the worst reasons.
But do not stain The even virtue of our enterprise, Nor th' insuppressive mettle of our spirits, To think that or our cause or our performance Did need an oath, when every drop of blood That every Roman bears—and nobly bears— Is guilty of a several bastardy If he do break the smallest particle Of any promise that hath passed from him.	Don’t spoil the justness and virtue of our endeavor nor weaken our own irrepressible spirits by thinking that we need a binding oath, when the blood that every noble Roman contains within him would be proven bastard’s blood if he broke the smallest part of any promise he had made.
But what of Cicero?	But what about Cicero?
Shall we sound him?	Should we see what he thinks?
I think he will stand very strong with us.	I think he will stand strong with us.
Let us not leave him out.	Let’s not leave him out.
No, by no means.	No, by no means.
O, let us have him, for his silver hairs Will purchase us a good opinion And buy men’s voices to commend our deeds.	Yes, we should get his support, for his mature presence will make others think well of us and speak out in support of our actions.
It shall be said his judgment ruled our hands.	They’ll assume that Cicero, with his sound judgment, ordered the actions.
O, name him not.	No, don’t even mention him.
Let us not break with him, For he will never follow anything That other men begin.	He’ll never follow anything that other men have started.
Then leave him out.	Then leave him out.
Indeed he is not fit.	Indeed, he’s not right for this.
Decius, well urged.	Good point, Decius.
I think it is not meet Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar, Should outlive Caesar.	I don’t think it would be wise to let Mark Antony, whom Caesar is so fond of, outlive Caesar.
We shall find of him A shrewd contriver.	We’d find that he was a dangerous plotter.
And, you know, his means, If he improve them, may well stretch so far As to annoy us all; which to prevent, Let Antony and Caesar fall together.	And as you know, his connections, if he put them to good use, might be enough to hurt us all.
Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius, To cut the head off and then hack the limbs, Like wrath in death and envy afterwards, For Antony is but a limb of Caesar.	Our action will seem too bloody if we cut off Caesar’s head and then hack at his arms and legs too, Caius Cassius—because Mark Antony is merely one of Caesar’s arms.
Let us be sacrificers but not butchers, Caius.	Let’s be sacrificers but not butchers, Caius.
We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar, And in the spirit of men there is no blood.	We’re all against what Caesar stands for, and there’s no blood in that.
Oh, that we then could come by Caesar’s spirit And not dismember Caesar!	Oh, how I wish we could oppose Caesar’s spirit—his overblown ambition—and not hack up Caesar himself!
But, alas, Caesar must bleed for it.	But, unfortunately, Caesar has to bleed if we’re going to stop him.
And, gentle friends, Let’s kill him boldly but not wrathfully.	Noble friends, let’s kill him boldly but not with anger.
Let’s carve him as a dish fit for the gods, Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds.	Let’s carve him up like a dish fit for the gods, not chop him up like a carcass fit for dogs.
And let our hearts, as subtle masters do, Stir up their servants to an act of rage And after seem to chide 'em.	Let’s be angry only long enough to do the deed, and then let’s act like we’re disgusted by what we had to do.
This shall make Our purpose necessary and not envious, Which so appearing to the common eyes, We shall be called purgers, not murderers.	This will make our actions seem practical and not vengeful.
If he love Caesar, all that he can do Is to himself: take thought and die for Caesar.	If he loves Caesar, then he can only hurt himself—by grieving and dying for Caesar.
And that were much he should, for he is given To sports, to wildness and much company.	And I’d be surprised if he even did that, for he prefers sports, fun, and friends.
There is no fear in him.	There’s nothing to fear in him.
Peace!	Quiet!
Count the clock.	Count how many times the clock chimes.
The clock hath stricken three.	The clock struck three.
Tis time to part.	It’s time to leave.
It may be, these apparent prodigies, The unaccustomed terror of this night, And the persuasion of his augurers May hold him from the Capitol today.	It might happen that these strange signs, the unusual terror of this night, and the urgings of his fortune-tellers will keep him away from the Capitol today.
Never fear that.	Don’t worry about that.
If he be so resolved, I can o'ersway him.	If he’s reluctant, I can convince him.
For he loves to hear That unicorns may be betrayed with trees, And bears with glasses, elephants with holes, Lions with toils, and men with flatterers.	He loves to hear me tell him how men can be snared by flatterers, just like unicorns can be captured in trees, elephants in holes, and lions with nets.
But when I tell him he hates flatterers, He says he does, being then most flatterèd.	When I tell him he hates flatterers, he agrees, just at the moment when I’m flattering him the most.
Let me work.	Let me work on him.
For I can give his humor the true bent, And I will bring him to the Capitol.	I can put him in the right mood, and I’ll bring him to the Capitol.
Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.	No, we’ll all go there to bring him.
By the eighth hour.	By eight o'clock.
Is that the uttermost?	Is that the latest we can do it?
Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard, Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey.	Caius Ligarius doesn’t like Caesar, who berated him for speaking well of Pompey.
I wonder none of you have thought of him.	I wonder that none of you thought about getting his support.
Now, good Metellus, go along by him.	Good Metellus, go to him now.
He loves me well, and I have given him reasons.	He likes me, and I’ve given him good reason to.
Send him but hither and I’ll fashion him.	Just send him here, and I’ll persuade him.
The morning comes upon ’s.	The morning is approaching.
We’ll leave you, Brutus.	We’ll leave, Brutus.
And, friends, disperse yourselves.	Friends, go your separate ways.
But all remember What you have said, and show yourselves true Romans.	But all of you, remember what you’ve said and prove yourselves true Romans.
Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily.	Good gentlemen, look like you’re rested and happy.
And so good morrow to you every one.	And so, good morning to all of you.
Boy!	Boy!
Lucius!—Fast asleep?	Lucius!
It is no matter.	Fast asleep?
Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber.	Well, enjoy the sweetness of deep sleep.
Therefore thou sleep’st so sound.	That’s why you sleep so soundly.
Brutus, my lord.	Brutus, my lord.
Portia, what mean you?	Portia, what are you doing awake?
It is not for your health thus to commit Your weak condition to the raw, cold morning.	It isn’t good for your health to expose your weak body to the raw, cold morning.
Nor for yours neither.	It’s not good for your health, either.
Y' have ungently, Brutus, Stole from my bed.	You rudely snuck out of bed.
And yesternight, at supper, You suddenly arose and walked about, Musing and sighing, with your arms across, And when I asked you what the matter was, You stared upon me with ungentle looks.	And last night at dinner, you got up abruptly and paced back and forth with your arms crossed, brooding and sighing, and when I asked you what was the matter, you gave me a dirty look.
I urged you further, then you scratched your head And too impatiently stamped with your foot.	I asked you again, and you scratched your head and stamped your foot impatiently.
Yet I insisted; yet you answered not, But with an angry wafture of your hand Gave sign for me to leave you.	I still insisted on knowing what the matter was, but you wouldn’t answer me, instead giving me an angry wave of your hand and telling me to leave you alone.
Dear my lord, Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.	My dear lord, tell me what’s bothering you.
And do you now strew flowers in his way That comes in triumph over Pompey’s blood?	And now you toss flowers in the path of Caesar, who comes in triumph over Pompey’s defeated sons?
Be gone!	Go home!
Run to your houses, fall upon your knees, Pray to the gods to intermit the plague That needs must light on this ingratitude.	Run to your houses, fall on your knees, and pray to the gods to spare you the pain that you deserve for such ingratitude.
Go, go, good countrymen, and for this fault, Assemble all the poor men of your sort, Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears Into the channel till the lowest stream Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.	Go, go, good countrymen, and to make up for having done wrong, gather up all the poor men like yourselves, lead them to the Tiber, and weep into the river until it overflows its banks.
Go you down that way towards the Capitol.	You go down toward the Capitol, and I’ll go this way.
This way will I. Disrobe the images If you do find them decked with ceremonies.	Undress the statues if they’re decorated in honor of Caesar.
May we do so?	Can we do that?
I’ll about And drive away the vulgar from the streets.	I’ll walk around and force the commoners off the streets.
So do you too, where you perceive them thick.	You do the same, wherever the crowds are thick.
These growing feathers plucked from Caesar’s wing Will make him fly an ordinary pitch, Who else would soar above the view of men And keep us all in servile fearfulness.	If we take away Caesar’s support, he’ll have to come back down to earth; otherwise, he’ll fly too high and keep the rest of us in a state of fear and obedience.
I am not well in health, and that is all.	I’m not feeling well—that’s all.
Brutus is wise, and were he not in health, He would embrace the means to come by it.	You’re smart, though, and if you were sick, you’d take what you needed to get better.
Why, so I do.	I’m doing so.
Good Portia, go to bed.	Good Portia, go to bed.
Is Brutus sick?	Are you sick?
And is it physical To walk unbracèd and suck up the humors Of the dank morning?	And is it healthy to walk uncovered and breathe in the dampness of the morning?
What, is Brutus sick, And will he steal out of his wholesome bed, To dare the vile contagion of the night And tempt the rheumy and unpurgèd air To add unto his sickness?	You’re sick, yet you sneak out of your warm bed and let the humid and disease-infested air make you sicker?
Kneel not, gentle Portia.	Don’t kneel, noble Portia.
You are my true and honorable wife, As dear to me as are the ruddy drops That visit my sad heart.	You’re my true and honorable wife, as dear to me as the blood that runs through my sad heart.
If this were true, then should I know this secret.	If that were true, then I’d know your secret.
I grant I am a woman, but withal A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife.	I admit I’m only a woman, but nevertheless I’m the woman Lord Brutus took for his wife.
I grant I am a woman, but withal A woman well-reputed, Cato’s daughter.	I admit I’m only a woman, but I’m still a woman from a noble family—I’m Cato’s daughter.
Think you I am no stronger than my sex, Being so fathered and so husbanded?	Do you really think I’m no stronger than the rest of my sex, with such a father and such a husband?
Tell me your counsels.	Tell me your secrets.
I will not disclose 'em.	I won’t betray them.
I have made strong proof of my constancy, Giving myself a voluntary wound Here in the thigh.	I’ve proved my trustworthiness by giving myself a voluntary wound here in my thigh.
Can I bear that with patience, And not my husband’s secrets?	If I can bear that pain, then I can bear my husband’s secrets.
O ye gods, Render me worthy of this noble wife!	Oh, gods, make me worthy of this noble wife!
Hark, hark!	Listen!
One knocks.	Someone knocks.
Leave me with haste.	Leave me quickly.
Lucius, who’s that knocking?	Lucius, who’s that knocking?
He is a sick man that would speak with you.	Here’s a sick man who wants to speak with you.
Would you were not sick!	How I wish you felt better!
I am not sick if Brutus have in hand Any exploit worthy the name of honor.	I’m not sick if you’ve prepared some honorable exploit for me.
Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius, Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.	Indeed, I would have such an exploit for you, Ligarius, if you were healthy enough to hear it.
A piece of work that will make sick men whole.	A deed that will make sick men healthy.
But are not some whole that we must make sick?	But aren’t there some healthy men whom we have to make sick?
That must we also.	That too.
What it is, my Caius, I shall unfold to thee as we are going To whom it must be done.	My dear Caius, I’ll explain the task at hand to you as we walk toward the man we must do it to.
Follow me, then.	Follow me, then.
Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight.	Neither the sky nor the earth have been quiet tonight.
Thrice hath Calphurnia in her sleep cried out, “Help, ho!	Calphurnia cried out three times in her sleep, “Help, someone!
They murder Caesar!”—Who’s within?	They’re murdering Caesar!” Who’s there?
My lord.	My lord?
Go bid the priests do present sacrifice And bring me their opinions of success.	Go tell the priests to perform a sacrifice immediately, and bring me their interpretation of the results.
I will, my lord.	I will, my lord.
What mean you, Caesar?	What are you doing, Caesar?
Think you to walk forth?	Are you planning to go out?
You shall not stir out of your house today.	You’re not leaving the house today.
Caesar shall forth.	I will go out.
The things that threatened me Ne'er looked but on my back.	The things that threaten me have only seen my back.
When they shall see The face of Caesar, they are vanishèd.	When they see the face of Caesar, they will vanish.
Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies, Yet now they fright me.	Caesar, I never believed in omens, but now they frighten me.
There is one within, Besides the things that we have heard and seen, Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.	A servant told me the night-watchmen saw horrid sights too, but different ones from what we heard and saw.
A lioness hath whelpèd in the streets, And graves have yawned and yielded up their dead.	A lioness gave birth in the streets, and graves cracked open and thrust out their dead.
Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds In ranks and squadrons and right form of war, Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol.	Fierce, fiery warriors fought in the clouds in the usual formations of war—ranks and squadrons—until the clouds drizzled blood onto the Capitol.
O Caesar!	Oh, Caesar!
These things are beyond all use, And I do fear them.	These things are beyond anything we’ve seen before, and I’m afraid.
What can be avoided Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?	How can we avoid what the gods want to happen?

I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.	Please, father, since you’re weak, act like it.
If till the expiration of your month, You will return and sojourn with my sister, Dismissing half your train, come then to me.	Get rid of half your knights and go back to spend the rest of your month with my sister.
I am now from home, and out of that provision Which shall be needful for your entertainment.	Right now I’m away from home and I can’t provide you with proper care.
Return to her, and fifty men dismissed?	Go back with her?
Return with her?	Go back with her?
Why, the hot-blooded France that dowerless took Our youngest born—I could as well be brought To knee his throne, and, squirelike, pension beg To keep base life afoot.	I might as well go before the King of France, who took my youngest daughter without a dowry, kneel before his throne, and beg him to give me a tiny pension to stay alive.
Return with her?	Go back with her?
Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter To this detested groom.	I’d rather be a slave or a packhorse for this hateful stablehand here.
At your choice, sir.	As you wish, sir.
Now, I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad.	I beg you, daughter, don’t make me crazy.
I will not trouble thee, my child.	I won’t bother you.
We’ll no more meet, no more see one another.	We’ll never see each other again.
But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter— Or rather a disease that’s in my flesh, Which I must needs call mine.	But you’re still my child, my flesh and blood—or rather you’re a disease in my flesh, a disease I still have to call my own.
Thou art a boil, A plague-sore or embossèd carbuncle In my corrupted blood.	You’re a pustule, a sore, a tumor digesting my bloodline.
But I’ll not chide thee.	But I’ll stop rebuking you.
I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot, Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove.	I won’t beg the gods to punish you, or caution you to fear their judgment.
Mend when thou canst.	Become a better
Be better at thy leisure.	person when you’re ready, if you’re inclined.
I can be patient.	I’ll wait patiently.
I can stay with Regan, I and my hundred knights.	Meanwhile I’ll stay with Regan with my hundred knights.
Not altogether so, sir.	It’s not quite that simple.
I looked not for you yet, nor am provided For your fit welcome.	I wasn’t expecting you, and I’m not ready to receive you.
Give ear, sir, to my sister.	Please hear what Goneril is saying.
For those that mingle reason with your passion Must be content to think you old, and so— But she knows what she does.	We’re trying to be reasonable while you’re so upset, and we understand that you’re old, and… But Goneril knows what she’s doing.
I dare avouch it, sir.	Yes, I do.
How, in one house, Should many people under two commands Hold amity?	How could so many people, under two masters, get along under one roof?
Tis hard; almost impossible.	It would be hard, almost impossible.
Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance From those that she calls servants, or from mine?	Why couldn’t you be attended by my servants, or by Regan’s?
Why not, my lord?	Yes, why not, my lord?
If then they chanced to slack you, We could control them.	Then if they’re negligent, we could control them.
If you will come to me— For now I spy a danger—I entreat you To bring but five and twenty.	Now that I think about the danger of these knights, if you come to stay with me, please bring no more than twenty-five of them with you.
To no more Will I give place or notice.	I won’t lodge any more than that under my roof.
I gave you all— And in good time you gave it.	I gave you everything— And it was about time too.
Made you my guardians, my depositaries, But kept a reservation to be followed With such a number.	I made you de facto rulers of my kingdom on condition that I could keep a hundred knights of my own.
What, must I come to you With five and twenty, Regan?	Why should I now have to make do with only twenty-five?
Said you so?	Regan, is that what you said?
And speak ’t again, my lord.	Yes, I’ll say it again, my lord.
No more with me.	No more than twenty-five.
Not being the worst Stands in some rank of praise.	Not being the worst daughter deserves some praise, I guess.
Hear me, my lord.	Hear me out, my lord.
What need you five and twenty, ten, or five To follow in a house where twice so many Have a command to tend you?	Why do you need twenty-five knights, or ten, or even five, when you’re staying in a house with a staff of double that at your service?
What need one?	Why do you need even one?
O, reason not the need!	Oh, don’t ask me why I “need” them!
Thou art a lady.	You’re a well-dressed lady.
If only to go warm were gorgeous, Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear’st, Which scarcely keeps thee warm.	If you dressed only to stay warm, you wouldn’t need these gorgeous clothes you’re wearing—which don’t keep you warm at all.
But, for true need— You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need.	Oh, gods, give me patience!
You see me here, you gods, a poor old man, As full of grief as age, wretched in both.	You see me here, gods, a grieving old man, as wretched in his grief as he is in his old age.
If it be you that stir these daughters' hearts Against their father, fool me not so much To bear it tamely.	If you’re the ones setting my daughters against me, don’t let me be foolish enough to take it lying down.
No, you unnatural hags,	man’s cheeks.
I will have such revenges on you both That all the world shall—I will do such things— What they are yet I know not, but they shall be The terrors of the earth.	No, you monstrous hags, I’ll get revenge on you both that will make the whole world… I will do such things—I don’t know what I’ll do exactly, but it’ll be devastating.
You think I’ll weep?	You expect me to cry?
No, I’ll not weep.	Well, I won’t.
I have full cause of weeping, but this heart Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws, Or ere I’ll weep.—O Fool, I shall go mad!	I have a good reason to cry, but my heart will splinter into a hundred thousand pieces before I let myself cry.—Oh, Fool, I’ll go mad!
Let us withdraw.	Let’s go inside.
Twill be a storm.	There’s going to be a storm.
This house is little.	This is a small house.
The old man and his people Cannot be well bestowed.	There’s no room for the old man and his followers.
Tis his own blame.	It’s his fault that he’s all worked up like this.
Hath put himself from rest, And must needs taste his folly.	He has to pay the price for his foolish actions.
So am I purposed.	That’s what I intend to do too.
Where is my lord of Gloucester?	Where is Gloucester?
Followed the old man forth.	He followed the old man.
He is returned.	Here he comes back.
Whither is he going?	Where’s he going?
He calls to horse, but will I know not whither.	He has called for his horse, but I don’t know where he’s headed.
Tis best to give him way.	It’s best just to let him go.
He leads himself.	He won’t listen to anyone’s advice.
For many miles about There’s scarce a bush.	There’s hardly a bush for miles around.
O sir, to wilful men, The injuries that they themselves procure Must be their schoolmasters.	Oh, sir, impetuous people learn their lessons from the consequences of their foolish actions.
Shut up your doors.	Lock the doors.
He is attended with a desperate train.	His attendants are desperate, violent men.
And what they may incense him to, being apt To have his ear abused, wisdom bids fear.	I’m afraid of what they might encourage him to do, considering the state he’s in.
Shut up your doors, my lord.	Lock the doors, my lord.
Tis a wild night.	It’s a wild night.
My Regan counsels well.	Regan gives good advice.
Come out o' th' storm.	Come in out of the storm.
Who’s there, besides foul weather?	Who’s there, aside from this foul weather?
One minded like the weather, most unquietly.	Someone whose mood is as foul as the weather, very troubled.
I know you.	I know you.
Where’s the king?	Where’s the king?
Contending with the fretful elements.	Struggling with the wind and rain.
Bids the winds blow the earth into the sea Or swell the curlèd water 'bove the main, That things might change or cease.	He’s shouting at the wind to blow the earth into the sea, or make the sea flood the earth—he wants to see the world return to primal chaos.
Tears his white hair, Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage, Catch in their fury and make nothing of.	He keeps tearing out his white hair, which the blindly raging winds catch up and blow away into nothingness.
Strives in his little world of man to outscorn The to-and-fro–conflicting wind and rain.	Small but brave in his surroundings, he’s trying to stand up against the wind and rain blowing back and forth.
This night—wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch, The lion and the belly-pinchèd wolf Keep their fur dry—unbonneted he runs, And bids what will take all.	He’s running bareheaded, calling for the end of the world, out there on a night like this, when even savage animals ravenous with hunger crawl under cover and hide.
But who is with him?	But who’s with him?
None but the fool, who labors to outjest His heart-struck injuries.	Nobody but the fool, who’s trying to soothe the wounds in the king’s heart with jokes.
Sir, I do know you, And dare upon the warrant of my note Commend a dear thing to you.	Sir, I know you, and I trust you enough to share something very important with you.
From France there comes a power Into this scattered kingdom, who already, Wise in our negligence, have secret feet In some of our best ports and are at point To show their open banner.	Some French agents are already at work in our main ports and are on the verge of declaring open war.
Now to you.	Now this is where you come in.
I am a gentleman of blood and breeding, And from some knowledge and assurance offer This office to you.	I’m a nobleman, and I know what I’m doing in assigning this job to you.
I will talk further with you.	Let’s discuss it some more.
Give me your hand.	Let me shake your hand.
Have you no more to say?	Do you have anything else to tell me?
Rage, blow!	Rage on, blow!
You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout Till you have drenched our steeples, drowned the cocks!	Let tornadoes spew water until the steeples of our churches and the weathervanes are all drowned.
You sulfurous and thought-executing fires, Vaunt-couriers of oak-cleaving thunderbolts, Singe my white head!	Let quick sulfurous lightning, strong enough to split enormous trees, singe the white hair on my head.
And thou, all-shaking thunder, Smite flat the thick rotundity o' th' world, Crack nature’s molds, all germens spill at once That make ingrateful man!	Let thunder flatten the spherical world, crack open all the molds from which nature forms human beings, and spill all the seeds from which ungrateful humans grow!
O nuncle, court holy water in a dry house is better than this rainwater out o' door.	Oh, uncle, it’s better to smile and flatter indoors where it’s dry than get soaked out here.
Good nuncle, in, and ask thy daughters blessing.	Please, uncle, let’s go in and ask your daughters to forgive you.
Here’s a night pities neither wise man nor fool.	This storm has no pity for either wise men or fools.
Rumble thy bellyful!	Let thunder rumble!
Spit, fire!	Let lightning spit fire!
Spout, rain!	Let the rain spray!
Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire are my daughters.	The rain, the wind, the thunder and lightning are not my daughters.
I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness.	Nature, I don’t accuse your weather of unkindness.
Why then, let fall Your horrible pleasure.	So go ahead and have your terrifying fun.
Here I stand, your slave— A poor, infirm, weak, and despised old man.	Here I am, your slave—a poor, sick, weak, hated old man.
He that has a house to put ’s head in has a good headpiece.	Anyone who has a house to cover his head has a good head on his shoulders.
Answer my life my judgment, Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least, Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound Reverbs no hollowness.	On my life I swear to you that your youngest daughter doesn’t love you least.
Kent, on thy life, no more.	Kent, if you want to stay alive, stop talking.
Out of my sight!	Get out of my sight!
See better, Lear, and let me still remain The true blank of thine eye.	Learn to see better, Lear, and let me stay here where you can look to me for good advice.
Now, by Apollo— Now, by Apollo, King, Thou swear’st thy gods in vain.	Now, I swear by Apollo… By Apollo, King, you’re taking the names of the gods in vain.
O vassal!	Oh, you lowlife!
Miscreant!	Scum!
Dear sir, forbear!	Please stop, sir.
Hear me, recreant!	Listen to me, you traitor.
For there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths    in a glass.	For there never was a pretty woman who didn’t like to preen in the mirror.
No, I will be the pattern of all patience.	No, I’ll be patient.
I will say nothing.	I won’t say a word.
Who’s there?	Who’s there?
Marry, here’s grace and a codpiece—that’s a wise man and a fool.	A wise man and a fool.
Let the great gods That keep this dreadful pudder o'er our heads Find out their enemies now.	Let the gods who stirred up this dreadful storm bring their enemies to light.
Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest.	It will give you some protection from this storm.
Repose you there, while I to this hard house— More harder than the stones whereof ’tis raised, Which even but now, demanding after you, Denied me to come in—return, and force Their scanted courtesy.	They are harder than the stones the house is made of.
My wits begin to turn.—   Come on, my boy.	I’m starting to lose my mind.
True, my good boy.—Come, bring us to this hovel.	That’s true, my good boy.—Come on, take us to that hut.
I’ll speak a prophecy ere I go.	I’ll recite a prophecy before I go.
Then comes the time, who lives to see ’t, That going shall be used with feet.	And whoever lives to see that day Will walk with his feet.
This prophecy Merlin shall make, for I live before his time.	This is the prophecy that the wizard
Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnatural dealing.	Oh, oh, Edmund, I don’t like this monstrous business.
When I desire their leave that I might pity him, they took from me the use of mine own house, charged me on pain of their perpetual displeasure neither to speak of him, entreat for him, nor any way sustain him.	When asked the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall if I could take pity on the king and shelter him from the storm, they took my house away from me and ordered me never to talk about him, lobby for him, or support him in any way.
Most savage and unnatural!	That’s uncivilized and unnatural!
Go to, say you nothing.	Oh, be quiet.
There’s a division betwixt the dukes.	There’s a feud between the two dukes.
Tis dangerous to be spoken.	It’s dangerous to talk about it.
I have locked the letter in my closet.	I’ve locked it up in my room.
These injuries the king now bears will be revenged home.	The humiliation that the king is suffering now will be revenged thoroughly.
There’s part of a power already footed.	Armed forces have already landed.
We must incline to the king.	We have to take the king’s side.
I will look him and privily relieve him.	I’ll look for him and secretly help him.
Go you and maintain talk with the duke, that my charity be not of him perceived.	You go and talk to the duke so he won’t notice I’m helping the king.
If he ask for me, I am ill and gone to bed.	If he asks to see me, tell him I’m sick and went to bed.
Though I die for it—as no less is threatened me—the king my old master must be relieved.	Even if I have to die—as they threaten—I have to help the king.
There is some strange thing toward, Edmund.	Strange things are about to happen, Edmund.
Pray you, be careful.	Please be careful.
This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the duke Instantly know, and of that letter too.	And I’ll tell him about the letter too.
The younger rises when the old doth fall.	The young generation rises while the old one falls.
Here is the place, my lord.	Here’s the hut, my lord.
Good my lord, enter.	Please go inside.
The tyranny of the open night’s too rough For nature to endure.	The night’s too rough for humans to bear.
Let me alone.	Leave me for a bit.
Good my lord, enter here.	My lord, here is the entrance.
Wilt break my heart?	Will you break my heart?
I had rather break mine own.	I’d rather break my own heart.
Good my lord, enter.	Now please go in.
Thou think’st ’tis much that this contentious storm Invades us to the skin.	You think it’s a big deal that this fierce storm is soaking me to the skin.
So ’tis to thee.	It’s a big deal to you.
But where the greater malady is fixed The lesser is scarce felt.	But whenever you feel a larger pain, the smaller one disappears.
Thou’dst shun a bear, But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea Thou’dst meet the bear i' th' mouth.	You would run away from a bear, but if the only way to run was into the stormy ocean, you’d turn around and confront the bear.
When the mind’s free, The body’s delicate.	When your mind is at peace, your body is sensitive to the elements.
The tempest in my mind Doth from my senses take all feeling else Save what beats there—filial ingratitude.	But this storm in my mind keeps me from feeling anything except what’s tormenting me—how ungrateful my children are!
Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand For lifting food to ’t?	Isn’t their ingratitude like the mouth biting the hand that feeds it?
But I will punish home.	But I’ll punish them thoroughly.
No, I will weep no more.	No, I won’t cry any more.
In such a night To shut me out!	Imagine them locking me out on a night like this!
Pour on, I will endure.	But let it rain; I’ll survive.
In such a night as this!	On a night like this!
O Regan, Goneril, Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all— Oh, that way madness lies.	Oh, Regan, Goneril, your kind old father whose generous heart gave you everything—Oh, if I think about that I’ll go mad.
Let me shun that.	I want to avoid that.
No more of that.	No more of these thoughts.
Good my lord, enter here.	My lord, please go inside here.
Prithee, go in thyself.	Go inside yourself.
Seek thine own ease.	Make yourself comfortable.
This tempest will not give me leave to ponder On things would hurt me more.	This storm protects me from thoughts that would hurt me more.
But I’ll go in.	But I’ll go in.
Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel, That thou mayst shake the superflux to them And show the heavens more just.	Go out and feel what the impoverished feel.
Come not in here, nuncle.	Don’t come in here, uncle!
Here’s a spirit.	There’s a spirit in here!
Help me, help me!	Help me, help me!
Give me thy hand.	Give me your hand.
Who’s there?	Who’s there?
A spirit, a spirit.	A ghost, a ghost!
He says his name’s Poor Tom.	He says his name’s Poor Tom.
What art thou that dost grumble there i' th' straw?	Who are you, moaning in the hut like that?
Come forth.	Come out.
Away!	Go away!
The foul fiend follows me!	The devil’s after me!
Through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind.	The cold wind blows through the hawthorn trees.
Hum!	Ha!
Go to thy cold bed and warm thee.	Get into your cold beds and warm yourselves up.
Didst thou give all to thy two daughters, and art thou come to this?	Did you give everything to your two daughters and end up like this?
Bless thy five wits.	Bless your five senses!
Tom’s a-cold.	Tom’s chilly.
Oh, do-de, do-de, do-de.	Oh do-de, do-de, do-de.
Bless thee from whirlwinds, star-blasting, and taking!	God protect you from tornadoes, evil stars, and diseases!
Do Poor Tom some charity, whom the foul fiend vexes.	Take pity on Poor Tom, who is persecuted by the devil.
There could I have him now—and there—and there again—and there.	There!… And over there!… And over there!
What, has his daughters brought him to this pass?— Couldst thou save nothing?	Have his daughters made him crazy like this?—Couldn’t you have kept something for yourself?
Wouldst thou give 'em all?	Did you have to give them everything?
Nay, he reserved a blanket, else we had been all shamed.	If he hadn’t, we’d all be embarrassed to look at him.
Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air Hang fated o'er men’s faults light on thy daughters!	Then may your daughters be cursed with all the horrible fates that await sinners!
He hath no daughters, sir.	He doesn’t have any daughters, sir.
Death, traitor!	Like hell!
Nothing could have subdued nature To such a lowness but his unkind daughters.	Nothing but cruel daughters could have degraded him like this.
Is it the fashion that discarded fathers Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?	Is it fashionable now for neglected fathers to get so little pity?
Twas this flesh begot Those pelican daughters.	I’m the one who fathered those bloodsucking daughters.
This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen.	This stormy night will turn us all into fools and madmen.
Take heed o' th' foul fiend.	Beware of the devil.
Obey thy parents, keep thy word’s justice, swear not, commit not with man’s sworn spouse, set not thy sweet heart on proud array.	Obey your parents, keep your word, don’t swear, don’t sleep with another man’s wife, and don’t covet flashy clothes.
Tom’s a- cold.	Tom’s chilly.
What hast thou been?	What were you before this?
Wine loved I deeply, dice dearly, and in woman outparamoured the Turk.	I loved wine and gambling, and had more women than a Turkish sultan keeps in his harem.
Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind, says, “Suum, mun, nonny.” Dauphin my boy, my boy, cessez.	The cold wind’s still blowing through the hawthorn tree.
Thou art the thing itself.	Look at him.
Unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor, bare, forked animal as thou art.—  Off, off, you lendings!	The human being unburdened by the trappings of civilization is no more than a poor, naked, two-legged animal like you.
Unbutton here.	Let me unbutton this.
Prithee, nuncle, be contented.	Please calm down, uncle.
Tis a naughty night to swim in.	This is a nasty night to go swimming.
Now a little fire in a wild field were like an old lecher’s heart—a small spark, all the rest on ’s body cold.	On a night like this a campfire in an empty field would be like the heart of a dirty old man—a tiny spark in a cold body.
Look, here comes a walking fire.	Look, here comes a walking fire.
This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet.	This is the devil Flibbertigibbet.
He begins at curfew and walks till the first cock.	He gets up at nightfall and wanders around till dawn.
And aroint thee, witch, aroint thee!	And go away, witch, go away.
How fares your grace?	How are you, your highness?
Who’s there?	Who are you?
What is ’t you seek?	What do you want?
What are you there?	Who are you?
Your names?	What are your names?
Peace, Smulkin.	Calm down, Smulkin, you fiend!
Modo he’s called, and Mahu.	He’s called Modo and Mahu.
Poor Tom’s a-cold.	Poor Tom’s chilly.
Go in with me.	Come back to my house with me.
My duty cannot suffer To obey in all your daughters' hard commands.	I couldn’t bear to obey all of your daughters' harsh orders.
Though their injunction be to bar my doors And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you, Yet have I ventured to come seek you out And bring you where both fire and food is ready.	They commanded me to lock my doors and leave you out in this merciless storm, but I’ve come out here to find you and take you where there’s warmth and food.
First let me talk with this philosopher.—	First let me talk with this philosopher here.—
Away!	Now get out of here!
By Jupiter, This shall not be revoked.	I swear by Jupiter I’ll never revoke this punishment.
Why, fare thee well, King.	Farewell, King.
Here’s France and Burgundy, my noble lord.	Here are the rulers of France and Burgundy, my lord.
My lord of Burgundy.	My lord the ruler of Burgundy, I’ll speak to you first.
We first address towards you, who with this king Hath rivaled for our daughter.	You’ve been competing with this king for my daughter.
Let me ask you one word in private.	Let me ask you something in private.
Canst thou blame him?	Can you blame him?
His daughters seek his death.	His daughters want to kill him.
Ah, that good Kent— He said it would be thus, poor banished man.	Ah, good old Kent said this would happen—that poor, banished man.
Thou say’st the king grows mad.	You say the king is losing his mind.
I’ll tell thee, friend, I am almost mad myself.	Let me tell you, my friend, I’m almost insane myself.
I had a son, Now outlawed from my blood.	I had a son, whom I’ve legally disowned.
He sought my life, But lately, very late.	He tried to kill me recently, very recently.
I loved him, friend— No father his son dearer.	I loved him, as much as any father ever loved his son.
What a night’s this!	What a storm!
O, cry your mercy, sir.—        Tom’s a-cold.	Excuse me, sir.— Tom’s chilly.
Keep thee warm.	Stay warm.
Come let’s in all.	Come on, let’s all go inside.
This way, my lord.	This way, my lord.
Come, good Athenian.	Come on, my dear Greek philosopher.
I will have my revenge ere I depart his house.	I’ll get my revenge before I leave this house.
How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature thus gives way to loyalty, something fears me to think of.	I’m afraid to think how I’ll be criticized for letting my natural affection for my father give way to my loyalty to you.
I now perceive it was not altogether your brother’s evil disposition made him seek his death, but a provoking merit set awork by a reprovable badness in himself.	Now I realize your brother tried to kill your father not just because your brother is an evil man, but because your father deserved it by being wicked himself.
How malicious is my fortune, that I must repent to be just!	How unlucky am I, having to apologize for doing the right thing!
Go with me to the duchess.	Come with me to see the duchess.

True or false, it hath made thee Earl of Gloucester.	Right or not, it’s made you the Earl of Gloucester.
I will lay trust upon thee, and thou shalt find a dearer father in my love.	I put my trust in you.
Here is better than the open air.	It’s better here than outside.
Take it thankfully.	Be happy about it.
I will piece out the comfort with what addition I can.	I’ll do what I can to make you even more comfortable.
I will not be long from you.	I won’t be gone long.
All the power of his wits have given way to his impatience.	He can’t bear his grief and so he’s losing his mind.
The gods reward your kindness!	May God reward you for your kindness!
A king, a king!	He’s a king, a king!
No, he’s a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son, for he’s a mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman before him.	No, he’s an ordinary guy who ’s got a gentleman for a son, since someone would have to be crazy to let his son become a gentleman before he’s achieved that distinction himself.
To have a thousand with red burning spits Come hissing in upon 'em!	I see Regan and Goneril in hell—A thousand hissing devils with sizzling red pitchforks come up to them!
The foul fiend bites my back.	The nasty devil’s biting my butt.
It shall be done.	I’ll do it.
The foul fiend haunts Poor Tom in the voice of a nightingale.	The devil sings like a nightingale to haunt Poor Tom.
Hoppedance cries in Tom’s belly for two white herring.	The demon Hoppedance is in Tom’s belly, crying for some fish to eat.

Is your name Goneril?	Is your name Goneril?
She cannot deny it.	She can’t deny it.
And here’s another, whose warped looks proclaim What store her heart is made on.	And here’s Regan, whose grotesque face betrays her twisted heart.
Stop her there!	Stop her!
Arms, arms, sword, fire, corruption in the place!	Fire!
False justicer, why hast thou let her ’scape?	You corrupt judge, why did you let her escape?
They’ll mar my counterfeiting.	Bless your heart.
The little dogs and all, Tray, Blanch, and Sweetheart—see, they bark at me.	Look at the three little dogs, Tray, Blanch, and Sweetheart—all barking at me.
Tom will throw his head at them.—Avaunt, you curs!	Tom will chase them off.—Go away, you mongrels!
Tooth that poisons if it bite, Mastiff, greyhound, mongrel grim,	Whether you bite to kill, Mastiff, greyhound, or ugly mutt,
Hound or spaniel, brach or him,  Bobtail tyke or trundle-tail—  Tom will make them weep and wail.	Hound or spaniel, bitch or dog, Whether your tail is short or curly— Tom will make you cry and wail.
For with throwing thus my head,  Dogs leap the hatch, and all are fled.	With one little toss of his head, He can scare you off for good.
Be thy mouth or black or white,  Do-de, de-de.	Whether your mouth is black or white, Do-dee, dee-dee da.
Cessez!	Stop!
Come, march to wakes and fairs and market towns.	Run off, go visit fairs and festivals!
Poor Tom, thy horn is dry.	Poor Tom, your cup is empty.
Is there any cause in nature that makes these hard hearts?	Is there any natural cause for hardening of the heart?
Now, good my lord, lie here and rest awhile.	Please lie down and rest a while, my lord.
Make no noise, make no noise.	Be quiet, be quiet.
Draw the curtains—so, so, so.	Draw the curtains, just like that.
We’ll go to supper i' th' morning.	We’ll have supper in the morning.
So, so, so.	That’s right.
And I’ll go to bed at noon.	And I’ll go to bed at noon.
Here, sir, but trouble him not.	He’s here, sir, but please don’t bother him.
His wits are gone.	He’s out of his right mind.
Good friend, I prithee, take him in thy arms.	Please get him, my friend, I beg you.
There is a litter ready.	Put
Come, help to bear thy master.	Carry your master out.
Come, come, away.	Come on, come on.
When we our betters see bearing our woes, We scarcely think our miseries our foes.	When we see that our betters have the same problems we do, we can almost forget our own misery.
Who alone suffers, suffers most i' th' mind, Leaving free things and happy shows behind.	The person who suffers alone suffers the most.
But then the mind much sufferance doth o'erskip When grief hath mates and bearing fellowship.	Companions in sorrow alleviate our grief.
Tom, away!	Let’s go, Tom.
What will hap more tonight, safe ’scape the king!	Whatever else happens tonight, I hope the king escapes safely!
Lurk, lurk.	Lurk out of sight.
Hang him instantly.	Hang him immediately.
Pluck out his eyes.	Gouge out his eyes!
Leave him to my displeasure.—Edmund, keep you our sister company.	Leave him to my wrath.—Edmund, go with my sister-in-law.
The revenges we are bound to take upon your traitorous father are not fit for your beholding.	You shouldn’t have to see the punishment we inflict on your father.
Advise the duke where you are going, to a most festinate preparation.	Tell the Duke of Albany to prepare for war immediately.
We are bound to the like.	We will do the same.
Our posts shall be swift and intelligent betwixt us.—Farewell, dear sister.	We’ll keep the lines of communication open between us.
How now?	Hello.
Where’s the king?	Where’s the king?
My lord of Gloucester hath conveyed him hence.	Lord Gloucester has helped him leave.
Some five or six and thirty of his knights, Hot questrists after him, met him at gate, Who with some other of the lord’s dependants Are gone with him towards Dover, where they boast To have well-armèd friends.	Thirty-five or thirty-six of his knights met him at the gate, and together with some others they’ve set off for Dover, where they claim to have powerful friends.
Get horses for your mistress.	Prepare the horses for your lady.
Farewell, sweet lord, and sister.	Goodbye, my sweet lord.—Goodbye, my sister.
Edmund, farewell.	Goodbye, Edmund.
Go seek the traitor Gloucester.	Go find the traitor Gloucester.
Pinion him like a thief, bring him before us.	Tie him up like a thief and bring him here to me.
Ingrateful fox, ’tis he.	That’s him.
Bind fast his corky arms.	Tie up his withered old arms.
What mean your graces?	What are you doing?
Good my friends, consider You are my guests.	My friends, remember that you’re my guests here.
Do me no foul play, friends.	Don’t play any nasty tricks on me.
Bind him, I say.	Tie him up, I tell you.
Most royal majesty, I crave no more than hath your highness offered.	Your highness, I want nothing more than what you’ve already offered.
Nor will you tender less.	I know you’ll offer nothing less than that.
Sir, there she stands.	There she is, over there.
I know no answer.	I don’t know what to say.
Sir, will you, with those infirmities she owes— Unfriended, new adopted to our hate, Dowered with our curse and strangered with our oath— Take her or leave her?	So do you take her or leave her?
Then leave her, sir, for by the power that made me, I tell you all her wealth.	Then leave her, sir.
Hard, hard.—O filthy traitor!	Tie him up harder.—You filthy traitor!
Unmerciful lady as you are, I’m none.	I’m not a traitor, unfair lady.
To this chair bind him.—Villain, thou shalt find— By the kind gods, ’tis most ignobly done To pluck me by the beard.	Tie him to this chair.—You’ll see, criminal— By the gods, it’s disgraceful for you to pull my beard.
So white, and such a traitor?	As old and white-haired as you are, and you’re such a traitor?
Naughty lady, These hairs which thou dost ravish from my chin Will quicken and accuse thee.	Wicked woman, these white hairs you’re pulling off my chin will come to life and accuse you of wrong-doing.
I am your host.	You are my guests.
With robbers' hands my hospitable favors You should not ruffle thus.	This is no way to treat a host who has welcomed you into his house.
What will you do?	What do you think you’re doing?
Come, sir, what letters had you late from France?	Tell us about the letters that you got from France.
Be simple-answered, for we know the truth.	Get to the point, since we already know the truth.
And what confederacy have you with the traitors Late footed in the kingdom?	And what’s your connection with the traitors who landed in our kingdom recently?
To whose hands You have sent the lunatic king.	The ones you’ve sent our lunatic king to.
Speak.	Tell us.
I have a letter guessingly set down, Which came from one that’s of a neutral heart, And not from one opposed.	It came from a neutral party, not from someone opposed to you.
Cunning.	How clever of you.
And false.	Clever lies.
Where hast thou sent the king?	Where have you sent the king?
To Dover.	To Dover.
Wherefore to Dover?	Why Dover?
Wast thou not charged at peril— Wherefore to Dover?—Let him first answer that.	Weren’t you ordered, on penalty of— Why Dover?—Let him answer that question first.
I am tied to th' stake, and I must stand the course.	I’m backed into a corner with nowhere to run.
Wherefore to Dover, sir?	Why Dover?
Because I would not see thy cruèl nails Pluck out his poor old eyes, nor thy fierce sister In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.	Because I didn’t want to watch while you gouged out his poor old eyes with your cruel fingernails, or while your vicious sister sank her fangs into his sacred flesh.
The sea, with such a storm as his bare head In hell-black night endured, would have buoyed up, And quenched the stellèd fires.	You left him out in the storm in the black night, bareheaded, a storm so terrible that if it had happened at sea, the waters would have risen up and extinguished the fire burning in the stars.
Yet poor old heart, he holp the heavens to rain.	And the poor old man just wept, mixing his tears with the rain.
If wolves had at thy gate howled that stern time, Thou shouldst have said, “Good porter, turn the key,” All cruèls else subscribed.	If wolves had been howling outside your gate at the heart of that storm, you would’ve told your doorman to let them in, despite all the cruelties you inflict on the world.
But I shall see The wingèd vengeance overtake such children.	But soon I’ll see the gods punish you for your lack of respect to your father.
See” ’t shalt thou never.—Fellows, hold the chair.— Upon these eyes of thine I’ll set my foot.	You won’t be seeing anything.—Hold his chair still, men.—I’m going to put my foot on his eyes.
He that will think to live till he be old, Give me some help!	Oh, help me, anyone who wants to live long!
O cruel!	Oh, so cruel!
O you gods!	Oh dear gods!
One side will mock another—th' other too.	Now he’s a little crooked.
But better service have I never done you Than now to bid you hold.	I’ve served you since childhood, but I’ve never done you a better service than telling you to stop.
How now, you dog?	What’s this, you dog?
If you did wear a beard upon your chin, I’d shake it on this quarrel.	I am willing to fight you if I must.
What do you mean?	What do you mean by all this?
Nay then, come on, and take the chance of anger.	Come on then.
Oh, I am slain!—My lord, you have one eye left To see some mischief on him.	I am dying!—My lord, you still have one eye left to see Cornwall punished.
Oh!	Oh!
Where is thy luster now?	Where’s your sparkle now?
Where’s my son Edmund?	Where’s my son Edmund?
Out, treacherous villain!	Wrong, evil traitor.
Thou call’st on him that hates thee.	You’re appealing to a son who hates you.
It was he That made the overture of thy treasons to us, Who is too good to pity thee.	He’s too good to have any compassion for you.
O my follies!	What a fool I’ve been!
Then Edgar was abused.	This means I’ve mistreated Edgar.
Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell His way to Dover.	He can sniff his way to Dover.
I have received a hurt.	I’m wounded.
Follow me, lady.— Turn out that eyeless villain.	Follow me, madam.—Throw the blind traitor outside.
Throw this slave Upon the dunghill.—Regan, I bleed apace.	And throw this dead peasant into the manure pit.—Regan, I’m bleeding.
Untimely comes this hurt.	It’s a bad time for such an injury.
Give me your arm.	Give me your arm.
I’ll never care what wickedness I do, If this man come to good.	If our criminal master gets off free, I won’t care what happens to me anymore.
If she live long, And in the end meet the old course of death, Women will all turn monsters.	If she lives a long and happy life, then all women may as well turn into monsters.
Let’s follow the old earl, and get the Bedlam To lead him where he would.	Let’s follow the old earl, and get that crazy Tom to take him wherever he wants to go.
His roguish madness Allows itself to any thing.	As a wandering lunatic, he can do whatever he wants.
Go thou.	Go ahead.
I’ll fetch some flax and whites of eggs To apply to his bleeding face.	I’ll get some cloth and egg whites to bandage his bleeding face.
Now heaven help him!	Heaven help him!
The lamentable change is from the best; The worst returns to laughter.	At the bottom, any change is for the better.
Welcome, then, Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace!	So I welcome this wind freely.
But who comes here?	But who is this?
My father, poorly led?	My father, led by a poor peasant?
World, world, O world!	Oh, life is full of surprises!
But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee, Life would not yield to age.	We age and die because they wear us out.
I have been your tenant and your father’s tenant these fourscore years.	I’ve rented land from you and your father for eighty years.
Away, get thee away.	Away, get out of here.
Good friend, be gone.	Leave me, my friend.
Alack, sir, you cannot see your way.	But you can’t see where you’re going, sir.
I have no way, and therefore want no eyes.	I don’t have anywhere to go, so I don’t need to see.
I stumbled when I saw.	When I could see, I didn’t always see clearly.
Full oft ’tis seen, Our means secure us and our mere defects Prove our commodities.	It’s often the case that having something makes us spoiled, while not having it turns out to be advantageous.
O dear son Edgar, The food of thy abusèd father’s wrath, Might I but live to see thee in my touch, I’d say I had eyes again!	If I live long enough to touch you again, that would be as good as having my eyesight back.
How now?	Who’s that?
Who’s there?	Who’s there?
Madman and beggar too.	Is it a beggar?
My son Came then into my mind, and yet my mind Was then scarce friends with him.	I was reminded of my son, even though I despised my son at that time.
I have heard more since.	Now I know better.
Is that the naked fellow?	Is that the naked guy?
Ay, my lord.	Yes, my lord.
Alack, sir, he is mad.	But sir, he’s crazy.
Tis the time’s plague when madmen lead the blind.	It’s the tragedy of our times that lunatics must lead the blind.
Do as I bid thee.	Do as I asked you.
Or rather, do thy pleasure.	Or rather, do what you feel like doing.
Sirrah, naked fellow— Poor Tom’s a-cold.	Hey, naked guy— Poor Tom’s chilly.
Come hither, fellow.	Come here, man.
Know’st thou the way to Dover?	Do you know the way to Dover?
Poor Tom hath been scared out of his good wits.	Poor Tom has been scared out of his mind.
So bless thee, master.	Bless you, master.
Ay, master.	Yes, sir.
There is a cliff, whose high and bending head Looks fearfully in the confinèd deep.	There’s a cliff there that leans precariously over the deep sea.
Bring me but to the very brim of it, And I’ll repair the misery thou dost bear With something rich about me.	Take me to the edge of it, and I’ll reward all your troubles with something valuable.
From that place I shall no leading need.	Once I’m there, I won’t need a guide anymore.
Give me thy arm.	Give me your arm.
Poor Tom shall lead thee.	Poor Tom will take you there.
Welcome, my lord.	Welcome, my lord.
I marvel our mild husband Not met us on the way.	I’m surprised my bland husband didn’t meet me on the way here.
Now, where’s your master?	Where’s your master?
Sure, her offense Must be of such unnatural degree That monsters it (or your fore-vouched affection Fall into taint), which to believe of her Must be a faith that reason without miracle Could never plant in me.	But it’d take a miracle to make me believe she could do anything that horrible.
Go to, go to.	Enough.
Better thou Hadst not been born than not t' have pleased me better.	It would’ve been better for you not to have been born at all than to displease me as you did.
Is it no more but this—a tardiness in nature Which often leaves the history unspoke That it intends to do?—My lord of Burgundy, What say you to the lady?	You mean this is the whole problem, that she is shy and hasn’t said everything she means to say and do?—My lord of Burgundy, what do you have to say to this lady?
Love’s not love When it is mingled with regards that stands Aloof from th' entire point.	Love’s not love when it gets mixed up with irrelevant outside matters.
Will you have her?	Will you marry her?
She is herself a dowry.	She herself is as valuable as any dowry could ever be.
Yours in the ranks of death.	I’m at your service until death.
My most dear Gloucester!	My dear Gloucester!
Oh, the difference of man and man!	What a man!—especially compared to my husband.
To thee a woman’s services are due.	Edmund, you deserve me to be your woman.
My fool usurps my body.	There’s a fool sharing my bed now.
Madam, here comes my lord.	Ma'am, my master’s coming.
I have been worth the whistle.	So you finally find me worthy of your attentions.
O Goneril, You are not worth the dust which the rude wind Blows in your face.	Goneril, you aren’t worth the dust the wind blows in your face.
I fear your disposition.	I don’t trust you.
That nature, which contemns its origin Cannot be bordered certain in itself.	You can’t trust anyone who abuses her own father, her flesh and blood.
She that herself will sliver and disbranch From her material sap perforce must wither And come to deadly use.	She will wither and come to a bad end.
No more.	Oh, shut up.
The text is foolish.	Your words are idiotic.
Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile.	Bad people can’t appreciate wisdom or goodness.
Filths savor but themselves.	They only like things as bad as themselves.
What have you done?	What have you two sisters done?
Tigers, not daughters, what have you performed?	You’re tigers, not daughters.
Could my good brother suffer you to do it— A man, a prince by him so benefited?	Could my good brother-in-law—a man to whom the
Where’s thy drum?	Coward!
Thou changèd and self-covered thing, for shame!	Shame on you, warped hag!
Bemonster not thy feature.	Your true demonic features are distorting your body.
Were ’t my fitness To let these hands obey my blood, They are apt enough to dislocate and tear Thy flesh and bones.	If I let myself do what I yearn to, I’d rip the flesh off your bones.
Howe'er thou art a fiend, A woman’s shape doth shield thee.	But I won’t attack a woman, even if she is a demon.
Marry, your manhood, mew!	I sneeze on your manhood.
What news?	What news do you bring?
Gloucester’s eyes?	Gloucester’s eyes?
But oh, poor Gloucester— Lost he his other eye?	There’s justice in heaven after all!
Both, both, my lord.— This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer.	That these crimes are punished so quickly is proof.
Tis from your sister.	But oh, poor Glou-cester!
One way I like this well.	Did he lose his other eye?
But being widow, and my Gloucester with her, May all the building in my fancy pluck Upon my hateful life.	He lost both, my lord.—Ma'am, this letter is from your sister, and needs an immediate answer.
Come with my lady hither.	He was on his way here with your wife.
He is not here.	But he isn’t here now.
No, my good lord.	No, my lord.
Ay, my good lord.	Yes, my lord.
Twas he informed against him, And quit the house on purpose that their punishment Might have the freer course.	He was the one who denounced his father.
Tell me what more thou know’st.	What else you do know?
Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back know you the reason?	Do you know why the King of France suddenly went back home?
Something he left imperfect in the state which, since his coming forth, is thought of; which imports to the kingdom so much fear and danger that his personal return was most required and necessary.	It was urgent and important enough to require his personal presence.
Who hath he left behind him general?	Whom did he leave in charge here?
The Marshal of France, Monsieur la Far.	The marshal of France, Monsieur la Far.
Did your letters pierce the queen to any demonstration of grief?	Was Queen Cordelia aggrieved by the letters you delivered?
Ay, sir.	Yes, sir.
It seemed she was a queen Over her passion, who, most rebel-like, Sought to be king o'er her.	She seemed to be trying to control her emotions, which were overwhelming her.
O, then it moved her?	So she was moved by it?
In brief, Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved If all could so become it.	If everyone looked so lovely in their sorrow, then sorrow would be highly prized.
Made she no verbal question?	She didn’t ask anything?
Faith, once or twice she heaved the name of “father” Pantingly forth as if it pressed her heart, Cried, “Sisters, sisters!	Actually, once or twice she sighed and said, “father,” as if the word were pressing on her chest.
Shame of ladies, sisters!	Once she exclaimed, “Sisters, sisters, shame on you!
Kent, father, sisters!	Kent, father, sisters!
What, i' th' storm, i' th' night?	What, out in a storm in the middle of the night?
Let pity not be believed.” There she shook The holy water from her heavenly eyes, And clamor moistened.	I can’t believe it.” The tears fell from her eyes like holy water.
Then away she started To deal with grief alone.	Then she ran away to grieve alone.
You spoke not with her since?	Have you not spoken to her since then?
No.	No.
Was this before the king returned?	Did this happen before the King of France returned home?
No, since.	No, afterward.
Why, good sir?	Why, good sir?
A sovereign shame so elbows him.	He’s too overwhelmed with shame.
His own unkindness That stripped her from his benediction turned her To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights To his dog-hearted daughters.	He remembers how unkind he was to her, how he disowned her and sent her abroad, how he gave her rightful inheritance to her two dog-hearted sisters.
These things sting His mind so venomously that burning shame Detains him from Cordelia.	All those memories pain his mind so deeply that guilt and shame keep him away from Cordelia.
Alack, poor gentleman!	Oh, the poor man!
Of Albany’s and Cornwall’s powers you heard not?	Have you heard about Albany’s and Cornwall’s troops?
Tis so.	I have.
They are afoot.	They’re on the march.
Well, sir, I’ll bring you to our master Lear And leave you to attend him.	Well, sir, I’ll take you to Lear and have you stay with him a while.
Some dear cause Will in concealment wrap me up awhile.	I have important business that requires me to remain in disguise a while longer.
When I am known aright you shall not grieve Lending me this acquaintance.	When I’ve revealed my true identity, you’ll be glad you took the time to help me out.
I pray you, go Along with me.	Please come with me.
Alack, ’tis he.	Sadly, it’s the king that’s missing.
Why, he was met even now As mad as the vexed sea, singing aloud, Crowned with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds, With burdocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers, Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow In our sustaining corn.—A century send forth.	They saw him just now as mad and deranged as the stormy sea, singing loudly, wearing a crown of nettles, thorns, hemlock, and all the other weeds that grow in our cornfields.—Send out a hundred soldiers to find him.
Search every acre in the high-grown field, And bring him to our eye.	Search high and low, in every acre of the fields, and bring him here for me to see him.
There is means, madam.	There is a way, ma'am.
Our foster nurse of nature is repose, The which he lacks—that to provoke in him Are many simples operative, whose power Will close the eye of anguish.	But there are many herbs that will help him rest and take his mind off his anguish for a while.
All blessed secrets, All you unpublished virtues of the earth, Spring with my tears.	Then I’ll water all those precious herbs with my tears to make them grow.
Be aidant and remediate In the good man’s distress.	May they relieve a sick old man’s suffering.
Seek, seek for him, Lest his ungoverned rage dissolve the life That wants the means to lead it.	Go find those herbs for him, before his madness puts his life in danger.
News, madam.	I have news, ma'am.
The British powers are marching hitherward.	The British forces are on their way here.
Tis known before.	We already knew that.
Our preparation stands In expectation of them.	Our forces are ready for them.
O dear father, It is thy business that I go about.	Oh, father, I’m taking care of your business.
Therefore great France My mourning and importuned tears hath pitied.	That’s why the King of France listened to my pleas and tears.
No blown ambition doth our arms incite, But love—dear love!—and our aged father’s right.	We’re not invading England out of ambition or greed, but out of love—dear love!—and my father’s right to his kingdom.
Soon may I hear and see him.	I hope I see him and hear him again soon.
But are my brother’s powers set forth?	Have my brother-in-law’s troops been mobilized?
Ay, madam.	Yes, ma'am.
Himself in person there?	Is he there in person?
Madam, with much ado.	Yes, making a big fuss.
Your sister is the better soldier.	Your sister’s the better soldier of the two.
Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?	Lord Edmund didn’t speak to your master at home?
No, madam.	No, ma'am.
What might import my sister’s letter to him?	What could my sister’s letter to him say?
I know not, lady.	I don’t know, ma'am.
Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.	He rushed away on serious business.
It was great ignorance, Gloucester’s eyes being out, To let him live.	It was a huge mistake to let old Gloucester live after we blinded him.
Where he arrives he moves All hearts against us.	Wherever he goes, he inspires compassion and people turn against us.
Edmund I think is gone In pity of his misery to dispatch His nighted life; moreover to descry The strength o' th' enemy.	And also to find out the size of the enemy army.
I must needs after him, madam, with my letter.	I have to follow him and give him the letter.
Our troops set forth tomorrow.	Our troops are deployed tomorrow.
Stay with us.	Stay with us tonight.
The ways are dangerous.	It’s dangerous out there.
Peace be with Burgundy.	Peace to you, my lord of Burgundy.
Since that respects and fortunes are his love, I shall not be his wife.	Since you love money and power so much, I won’t be your wife.
Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon, Be it lawful I take up what’s cast away.	I’ll take you and your wonderful virtues here and now, if it’s okay that I’m picking up what others have thrown away.
Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy Can buy this unprized precious maid of me.— Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind.	No Duke of spineless Burgundy can take this treasure of a girl from me now.—Say goodbye to them, Cordelia, even though they’ve been unkind to you.
Let her be thine, for we Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see That face of hers again.	She’s no longer my daughter, and I’ll never see her face again.
Bid farewell to your sisters.	Say goodbye to your sisters.
I may not, madam.	I can’t, ma'am.
My lady charged my duty in this business.	My lady ordered me to deliver her letter.
Why should she write to Edmund?	Why would she write to Edmund?
Belike Some things—I know not what.	It probably has something to do with… I don’t know.
Madam, I had rather— I know your lady does not love her husband.	Ma'am, I’d rather— I know your lady Goneril doesn’t love her husband.
I am sure of that.	I’m sure of that.
And at her late being here She gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks To noble Edmund.	And when she was here recently she flirted with Edmund and gave him significant glances.
I know you are of her bosom.	I know she trusts you and tells you everything.
I, madam?	Me, ma'am?
I speak in understanding.	I know what I’m talking about.
Therefore I do advise you, take this note.	So I recommend you take note of what I’m about to say.
My lord is dead.	My husband is dead.
Edmund and I have talked, And more convenient is he for my hand Than for your lady’s.	Edmund and I have talked, and it makes more sense for him to marry me than Goneril.
You may gather more.	You can figure out the rest.
Fare thee well.	Goodbye.
When shall we come to th' top of that same hill?	When will we get to the top of that cliff?
Methinks the ground is even.	The ground feels flat to me.
Horrible steep.	No, it’s dreadfully steep.
No, truly.	No, really, I don’t.
Why then, your other senses grow imperfect By your eyes' anguish.	Then your other senses must be getting worse because of the trauma of blindness.
So may it be indeed.	It may be so.
Methinks thy voice is altered, and thou speak’st In better phrase and matter than thou didst.	It seems to me that your voice has changed, and that your speech is more elegant than it used to be.
You’re much deceived.	You’re mistaken about all that.
In nothing am I changed But in my garments.	The only thing different about me is my clothes.
Methinks you’re better spoken.	I think you’re more articulate.
Come on, sir.	Come on, sir.
Here’s the place.	This is the place.
Stand still.	Stand still.
How fearful And dizzy ’tis to cast one’s eyes so low!	It’s so scary to look down!
The crows and choughs that wing the midway air Show scarce so gross as beetles.	The crows flying down below look as small as ants.
Halfway down Hangs one that gathers samphire—dreadful trade!	Halfway down the cliff there’s somebody clinging to the rock and gathering wild herbs—a risky business!
And yon tall anchoring bark,	That big ship over there looks no bigger
The murmuring surge That on th' unnumbered idle pebbles chafes Cannot be heard so high.	Up here you can’t even hear the waves crashing against the rocks.
Set me where you stand.	Lead me to where you’re standing.
Give me your hand.	Give me your hand.
You are now within a foot Of th' extreme verge.	You’re now within a foot of the cliff’s edge.
Let go my hand.	Let go of my hand.
Now fare you well, good sir.	Goodbye, good sir.
With all my heart.	With all my heart.
O you mighty gods,  This world I do renounce, and in your sights Shake patiently my great affliction off.	Oh, you mighty gods!
Gone, sir.	Gone, sir.
Farewell.	Goodbye.
Away, and let me die.	Go away and let me die.
Ten masts at each make not the altitude Which thou hast perpendicularly fell.	You just fell the height of ten ship masts, straight down.
Thy life’s a miracle.	It’s a miracle you’re alive.
Speak yet again.	Say something again.
But have I fall'n, or no?	But did I fall or not?
From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.	You fell from the terrifying top of this chalk cliff.
Look up a-height.	Look for yourself—see the top of the cliff way up there?
The shrill-gorged lark so far Cannot be seen or heard.	The lark shrilly singing up there is too far away to be heard.
Do but look up.	Just look.
Twas yet some comfort When misery could beguile the tyrant’s rage And frustrate his proud will.	It used to be the last ditch comfort of miserable people.
Give me your arm.	Give me your arm.
Up so.	Get up.
How is ’t?	How do you feel?
Feel you your legs?	Can you feel your legs?
You stand.	You’re standing.
Too well, too well.	Only too well.
This is above all strangeness.	This is beyond weird.
Upon the crown o' th' cliff, what thing was that Which parted from you?	What was that thing I saw moving away from you up on the cliff before you fell?
A poor unfortunate beggar.	That was a poor unlucky beggar.
As I stood here below, methought his eyes Were two full moons.	From down here, I thought his eyes looked like full moons.
He had a thousand noses, Horns whelked and waved like the enragèd sea.	He had a thousand noses and twisted horns, like wave crests in a storm at sea.
It was some fiend.	It was some devil.
I do remember now.	I understand now.
Henceforth I’ll bear Affliction till it do cry out itself, “Enough, enough,” and die.	From now on I’ll put up with my anguish until the anguish itself cries out, “Enough, enough!” and disappears.
That thing you speak of, I took it for a man.	I thought that thing you’re talking about was a man.
Bear free and patient thoughts.	Cheer up and be at peace.
But who comes here?	But who is that?
I am the king himself.	I’m the king himself.
Look, look, a mouse!	Life’s better at
peace, this piece of toasted cheese will do ’t.	piece of cheese will get him.—I challenge you to a match.

I' th' clout, i' th' clout.	Whoosh!
Sweet marjoram.	Sweet marjoram.
Pass.	That’s it!
I know that voice.	I know that voice.
Ha!	Ha!
Goneril with a white beard?	Goneril with a white beard?
Go to, they are not men o' their words.	I tell you, they are not honest men.
They told me I was everything.	They told me I was everything.
The trick of that voice I do well remember.	I recognize something about that voice.
Is ’t not the king?	Isn’t that the king?
Ay, every inch a king.	Yes, every inch a king.
I pardon that man’s life.	I pardon that man.
What was thy cause?	What are you accused of?
Adultery?	Adultery?
Thou shalt not die.	I’ll commute your death sentence.
Die for adultery?	To die for adultery?
No.	No.
The wren goes to ’t, and the small gilded fly does lecher in my sight.	Little birds do it, and dragonflies copulate right in front of me.
Let copulation thrive, for Gloucester’s bastard son Was kinder to his father than my daughters got ’tween the lawful sheets.	Let’s have more sex in the world, since Gloucester’s bastard son was kinder to him than my daughters, conceived in lawful wedlock, have been to me.
To ’t, luxury, pell-mell—for I lack soldiers.	Get to it, be lustful, sleep around—I need soldiers for my army.
Down from the waist they are centaurs, though women all above.	Women are sex machines below the waist, though they’re chaste up above.
There’s hell, there’s darkness, there’s the sulfurous pit— burning, scalding, stench, consumption!	That’s where hell is, and darkness, and fires and stench!
Fie, fie, fie, pah, pah!—Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary, to sweeten my imagination.	Give me an aphrodisiac, pharmacist.
There’s money for thee.	There’s money in it for you.
O, let me kiss that hand!	Oh, let me kiss his hand!
Let me wipe it first.	Let me wipe it off first.
I remember thine eyes well enough.	I remember your eyes quite well.
Dost thou squiny at me?	Are you squinting at me?
Read thou this challenge.	Read it.
Read.	How?
What, with the case of eyes?	With my eye sockets?
Oh ho, are you there with me?	Oh ho, is that what you’re getting at?
No eyes in your head, nor no money in your purse?	No eyes in your head til there’s money in your wallet?
What, art mad?	What, are you crazy?
A man may see how this world goes with no eyes.	You don’t need eyes to see how the world works.
Look with thine ears.	Look with your ears.
See how yon justice rails upon yon simple thief.	Look how the judge yells at a simple thief.
Thou hast seen a farmer’s dog bark at a beggar?	Have you seen a farmer’s dog bark at a beggar?
Ay, sir.	Yes, sir.
And the creature run from the cur?	And you saw how the beggar ran from the mutt?
There thou mightst behold the great image of authority: a dog’s obeyed in office.	That’s authority!
Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand.	You stupid cop, stop your violence!
Why dost thou lash that whore?	Why are you whipping that whore?
Thou hotly lust’st to use her in that kind  For which thou whipp’st her.	You should be whipping yourself, since you lust after her and yearn to do the same thing for which you’re punishing her.
The usurer hangs the cozener.	One criminal punishes another.
None does offend—none, I say, none.	You can’t blame anyone for it anyone, I say.
I’ll able 'em.	I’ll vouch for that.
Take that of me, my friend, who have the power  To seal th' accuser’s lips.	Believe me, my friend, since I have the power to stop the prosecutors.
Harder, harder.	Harder, harder.
So.	Like that.
If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.	If you want to cry over my bad luck, I’ll give you my eyes.
I know thee well enough.	I know you.
Thy name is Gloucester.	Your name’s Gloucester.
Thou must be patient.	You have to be patient with me.
We came crying hither.	I came here crying.
Thou know’st the first time that we smell the air We wawl and cry.	The first time we see the world as newborns, we cry and scream.
I will preach to thee.	I’ll read you a sermon.
Mark me.	Listen to this.
Alack, alack the day!	Oh, how awful!
When we are born, we cry that we are come To this great stage of fools.	When we’re born, we cry because we’ve arrived on the stage of life, like all the other fools.
This a good block.	That’s a nice hat you’ve got there.
It were a delicate stratagem to shoe A troop of horse with felt.	How ingenious to make horseshoes out of felt.
I’ll put ’t in proof.	I’ll test it out.
And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law, Then, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!	And when I’ve sneaked up on my sons-in-law, then I’ll kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!
What, a prisoner?	What, I’m a prisoner?
I am even The natural fool of fortune.	No rescue for me?
Use me well.	Treat me well.
You shall have ransom.	There’s a ransom.
Let me have surgeons.	I need a doctor.
I am cut to th' brains.	My brains are injured.
You shall have anything.	You can have anything you want.
No seconds?	Will no one back me up?
All myself?	Am I all alone?
Why, this would make a man a man of salt, To use his eyes for garden water-pots, Ay, and laying autumn’s dust.	That would make anyone cry enough to water his garden with his tears.
Good sir—	Good sir—
I will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom.	I’ll die  You’re of royal blood, and we obey you.
What, I will be jovial.	Then there’s still a chance.
Come, come.	Come and get it!
I am a king, my masters, know you that?	But you’ll have to catch me!
You are a royal one, and we obey you.	Catch me if you can!
Then there’s life in ’t.	Sa, sa, sa, sa.
A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch, Past speaking of in a king.	In a king, the sight is unbearable.
Hail, gentle sir.	Hello, good sir.
Sir, speed you.	How do you do, sir.
What’s your will?	How can I help you?
Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?	Have you heard any news of impending battle?
Most sure and vulgar.	Certainly.
Everyone hears that That can distinguish sound.	Everyone who can hear has heard about it.
But, by your favor, how near’s the other army?	Could you tell me how near the enemy is?
Near and on speedy foot.	Very near, and approaching fast.
The main descry Stands in the hourly thought.	The main body of the army is expected here any hour now.
I thank you, sir.	Thank you, sir.
That’s all.	That’s all I wanted to know.
I know you what you are, And like a sister am most loath to call Your faults as they are named.	I know you for what you really are, but as your sister I’m reluctant to criticize you.
But yet, alas, stood I within his grace, I would prefer him to a better place.	I leave him in your care—but oh, if only I were still in his favor I could arrange for better care for him.
So farewell to you both.	Goodbye to you both.
Prescribe not us our duty.	Don’t tell us what our duty is.
Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides, Who covers faults at last with shame derides.	Time will tell what you’ve got up your sleeve.
Well may you prosper.	Have a good life.
Come, my fair Cordelia.	Come with me, my dear Cordelia.
Sister, it is not a little I have to say of what most nearly appertains to us both.	Sister, I have a lot to say about things that concern us both.
I think our father will hence tonight.	I think that our father will leave here tonight.
That’s most certain, and with you.	Yes, I’m sure he will—to stay with you.
Next month with us.	Next month he’ll stay with us.
You see how full of changes his age is.	He’s so flighty in his old age, as we keep noticing.
He always loved our sister most, and with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off appears too grossly.	He has always loved Cordelia best, and his bad judgment in disowning her now is obvious.
Though that the queen on special cause is here, Her army is moved on.	The queen is here on special business, and her army has moved on.
I thank you, sir.	Thank you, sir.
You ever gentle gods, take my breath from me.	Gentle gods in heaven, please let me die.
Let not my worser spirit tempt me again To die before you please.	Don’t tempt me to suicide again.
Well pray you, father.	Pray well, father.
Now, good sir, what are you?	And who are you, good sir?
A most poor man made tame to fortune’s blows, Who by the art of known and feeling sorrows Am pregnant to good pity.	I’m a poor man who’s been humbled by many misfortunes.
Hearty thanks.	Thank you very much.
The bounty and the benison of heaven To boot and boot.	May heaven bless you.
Most happy!	What good luck!
That eyeless head of thine was first framed flesh To raise my fortunes.	That blind head of yours was created to make me rich.
Thou old unhappy traitor, Briefly thyself remember.	You old traitor, repent all your sins.
Now let thy friendly hand Put strength enough to ’t.	I hope you’re strong enough to do it.
Wherefore, bold peasant, Darest thou support a published traitor?	Whoa, man, you dare to support someone who’s been proclaimed a traitor?
Hence, Lest that th' infection of his fortune take Like hold on thee.	Get out of here, before his bad luck infects you too.
Let go his arm.	Let go of his arm.
Chill not let go, zir, without vurther 'casion.	Oh no, sir, I won’t let him go, sir, not without a good reason.
Let go, slave, or thou diest!	Let go of him, peasant, or you die!
Chill pick your teeth, zir.	I’ll knock your teeth out, sir.
Come, no matter vor your foins.	To hell with your sword.
If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body.	I know you well.
I know thee well—a serviceable villain, As duteous to the vices of thy mistress As badness would desire.	You’re a hardworking villain who’d do anything his evil mistress wanted him to.
What, is he dead?	Is he dead?
Let’s see these pockets.	Let’s look in his pockets.
The letters that he speaks of  May be my friends.	The letters he spoke of may help me.
He’s dead.	He’s dead.
I am only sorry  He had no other death’s-man.	I’m just sorry I had to be the one to kill him.
Let us see.	Let’s see here.
Leave, gentle wax, and, manners, blame us not.	Come on, envelope, open up for me.
Their papers is more lawful.	Reading their mail isn’t as bad.
Let our reciprocal vows be remembered.	Don’t forget the vows we made to each other.
The king is mad.	The king is insane.
Better I were distract— So should my thoughts be severed from my griefs, And woes by wrong imaginations lose The knowledge of themselves.	It’d be better to be delirious and unaware of anything.
Give me your hand.	Give me your hand.
Far off methinks I hear the beaten drum.	I think I hear the drums far away.
Come, father, I’ll bestow you with a friend.	Come, father, I’ll leave you at a friend’s house.
O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work To match thy goodness?	Oh, Kent, what could I ever do to become as good as you are?
My life will be too short, And every measure fail me.	I won’t live long enough, and all my efforts will fail me.
To be acknowledged, madam, is o'erpaid.	Just being thanked is more than enough for me, madam.
All my reports go with the modest truth, Nor more, nor clipped, but so.	I hope all reports about me simply tell the truth, no more or less.
Be better suited.	Change into better clothes.
I prithee, put them off.	Please take them off.
My boon I make it that you know me not Till time and I think meet.	I have to ask you, as a favor, not to let on that you recognize me until the time is right.
Then be ’t so, my good lord.— How does the king?	All right, my lord.—How’s the king doing?
Madam, sleeps still.	He’s still sleeping, ma'am.
So please your majesty That we may wake the king?	Would you mind if we woke up the king?
He hath slept long.	He’s slept a long time.
Is he arrayed?	Is he in his royal garments?
Ay, madam.	Yes, ma'am.
Be by, good madam, when we do awake him.	Stay close by when we wake him up, ma'am.
I doubt not of his temperance.	I’m sure he will stay under control.
Very well.	All right.
Please you, draw near.—Louder the music there!	Please come closer.— Make the music louder, please!
Kind and dear princess!	Kind and dear princess!
Had you not been their father, these white flakes Did challenge pity of them.	If you hadn’t been their father, your white hair would have inspired in them only compassion.
And wast thou fain, poor father, To hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn In short and musty straw?	And were you then happy to find shelter on a bed of hay along with swine and homeless bums?
Alack, alack!	Oh, oh!
Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once Had not concluded all.—He wakes.	It’s a wonder you didn’t lose your life and your mind all at once.—He’s waking up.
Speak to him.	Talk to him.
Madam, do you.	You talk to him, ma'am.
Tis fittest.	That’s most appropriate.
How does my royal lord?	How are you, my royal lord?
How fares your majesty?	How is your majesty doing?
You do me wrong to take me out o' th' grave.	You do me wrong by taking me out of the grave.
Thou art a soul in bliss, but I am bound Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears Do scald like molten lead.	Even my tears burn me like molten lead.
Sir, do you know me?	Sir, do you know who I am?
You are a spirit, I know.	You’re a spirit, I know.
Where did you die?	Where did you die?
Let him alone awhile.	Let him be for a bit.
Where have I been?	Where have I been?
Where am I?	Where am I?
Fair daylight?	Is it daytime?
I am mightily abused.	I’ve been tricked.
I should ev'n die with pity To see another thus.	I would die of pity to see someone else in my condition.
I know not what to say.	I don’t know what to say.
I will not swear these are my hands.	I can’t even be sure these are my hands.
Let’s see.	Let’s see.
I feel this pinprick.	I feel this pinprick.
Would I were assured Of my condition.	I wish I knew what is happening.
Pray, do not mock me.	Please don’t make fun of me.
I am a very foolish fond old man, Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less.	I’m a foolish, senile old man, eighty-something years old, not an hour more or less.
And to deal plainly I fear I am not in my perfect mind.	To put it plainly, I’m afraid I’m not quite sane.
Methinks I should know you, and know this man.	I feel I should recognize you and that man
Nor I know not Where I did lodge last night.	I can’t recall where I slept last night.
Do not laugh at me, For as I am a man, I think this lady To be my child Cordelia.	Don’t laugh at me, but I swear I think this lady is my child Cordelia.
And so I am, I am.	And I am, I am.
Be your tears wet?	Are your tears wet?
Yes, faith.	Yes, indeed they are.
I pray, weep not.	Please don’t cry.
If you have poison for me, I will drink it.	If you have poison for me, I’ll drink it.
You have some cause; they have not.	But you didn’t, even though you had every reason.
No cause, no cause.	I had no reason, no reason.
Am I in France?	Am I in France?
In your own kingdom, sir.	You’re in your own kingdom, sir.
Do not abuse me.	Don’t deceive me.
Be comforted, good madam.	You can relax, ma'am.
The great rage, You see, is killed in him.	His insane period is over.
And yet it is danger To make him even o'er the time he has lost.	But it’s dangerous to make him try to make sense of the time he lost.
Desire him to go in.	Ask him to go in.
Trouble him no more Till further settling.	Don’t trouble him further until his mind is more settled.
Will ’t please your highness walk?	Would your highness like to take a walk?
You must bear with me.	You’ll have to bear with me.
Pray you now, forget and forgive.	Please forgive and forget.
I am old and foolish.	I’m old and foolish.
Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was so slain?	Is it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was killed as they say?
Most certain, sir.	Yes, it’s true, sir.
Who is conductor of his people?	Who is leading his men?
As ’tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.	They say Gloucester’s bastard son is.
They say Edgar, his banished son, is with the Earl of Kent in Germany.	I hear that Edgar, Gloucester’s exiled son, is with the Earl of Kent in Germany.
Report is changeable.	You can’t trust all the rumors.
Tis time to look about.	It’s time to reassess the situation.
The powers of the kingdom approach apace.	The British troops are coming near.
The arbitrament is like to be bloody.	It will likely be a bloody fight.
Fare you well, sir.	Goodbye, sir.
Tis to be doubted, madam.	I’m afraid that may be the case, madam.
Now, sweet lord, You know the goodness I intend upon you.	Now, my sweet lord, you know how much I like you.
Tell me but truly—but then speak the truth— Do you not love my sister?	Tell me truthfully, do you love my sister?
In honored love.	No.
I am doubtful that you have been conjunct And bosomed with her as far as we call hers.	I’m just worried that you’ve been cozying up to her, and gotten intimate with her.
No, by mine honor, madam.	No, I swear on my honor, I haven’t, madam.
Tis the infirmity of his age.	He’s going senile.
Yet he hath ever but slenderly known himself.	But then again he’s never really understood his own feelings very well.
The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash.	Yes, he was hotheaded even in the prime of his life.
Then must we look from his age to receive not alone the imperfections of long-engrafted condition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring with them.	Now that he’s old, we can expect to have to deal not only with his old character flaws, which have turned into deep-rooted habits, but also with the uncontrollable crabbiness that comes with old age.
Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of Kent’s banishment.	We’ll probably witness many more outbursts from him, like banishing Kent.
There is further compliment of leave-taking between France and him.	There’s still the King of France’s farewell ceremony.
Pray you, let’s sit together.	Let’s put our heads together.
If our father carry authority with such dispositions as he bears, this last surrender of his will but offend us.	If our father continues to use his authority as usual, then his recent abdication of the kingdom will just hurt us.
We shall further think on ’t.	We’ll have to think about it carefully.
We must do something, and i' th' heat.	We have to strike while the iron’s hot.
I never shall endure her.	I can’t stand her.
Dear my lord, Be not familiar with her.	Please, my lord, don’t be friendly with her.
Fear me not.— She and the duke her husband!	Don’t worry about me.—Your sister and the duke are here.
Sir, you speak nobly.	Noble words, sir.
Why is this reasoned?	Why are we talking about this?
Let’s then determine with the ancient of war On our proceedings.	Then let’s meet with our senior command and discuss what to do next.
I shall attend you presently at your tent.	I’ll meet you at your tent.
Sister, you’ll go with us?	Goneril, are you coming with us?
No.	No.
Tis most convenient.	It’s the best thing to do.
Pray you, go with us.	Please come with me.
Stay till I have read the letter.	Wait until I read the letter.
I was forbid it.	I was ordered not to.
When time shall serve, let but the herald cry, And I’ll appear again.	When the time comes, tell the herald to blow the trumpet and I’ll return.
Why, fare thee well.	Goodbye, then.
I will o'erlook thy paper.	I’ll take a look at your letter.
Draw up your powers.	Prepare your troops.
We will greet the time.	We’ll be ready when the time comes.
Which of them shall I take?	Which one of them should I pick?
Both?	Both?
One?	One?
Or neither?	Neither?
Neither can be enjoyed If both remain alive.	I can’t enjoy either of them as long as the other one’s alive.
To take the widow Exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril, And hardly shall I carry out my side, Her husband being alive.	Goneril would go crazy if I chose Regan, but it would be hard to get in with Goneril while her husband’s still alive.
Now, then, we’ll use His countenance for the battle, which being done, Let her who would be rid of him devise His speedy taking off.	I’ll use Albany’s power and authority for now to win the war, but afterward one of the sisters—whichever one wants to—can get rid of him.
If ever I return to you again, I’ll bring you comfort.	If I ever come back, I’ll bring you good news.
Grace go with you, sir.	Good luck, sir.
Away, old man.	We have to get out of here, old man.
Give me thy hand.	Let me help you up.
Away!	Let’s go!
King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter ta'en.	He and his daughter are captured.
Give me thy hand.	Give me your hand.
Come on.	Come on.
No further, sir.	I can’t go any further, sir.
Come on.	Come on.
And that’s true too.	And that’s true too.
Some officers take them away.	Officers, take them away.
Good guard Until their greater pleasures first be known That are to censure them.	Guard them carefully until we decide how to punish them.
No, no, no, no!	No, no, no, no!
Come, let’s away to prison.	Come on, let’s go to prison.
We two alone will sing like birds i' th' cage.	The two of us together will sing like birds in a cage.
When thou dost ask me blessing, I’ll kneel down And ask of thee forgiveness.	When you ask for my blessing, I’ll get down on my knees and ask you to forgive me.
And we’ll wear out In a walled prison packs and sects of great ones That ebb and flow by the moon.	In prison we’ll outlast hordes of rulers that will come and go as their fortunes change.
Take them away.	Take them away.
Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia, The gods themselves throw incense.	My Cordelia, even the gods admire how much you’ve sacrificed for me.
Have I caught thee?	Have I hugged you yet?
He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven And fire us hence like foxes.	Anyone who wants to separate us will have to smoke us out of the cave of our togetherness like foxes.
Wipe thine eyes.	Wipe your eyes.
The good years shall devour them, flesh and fell, Ere they shall make us weep.	Our jailers will shrivel up with old age before they make us cry again.
We’ll see 'em starve first.	We’ll watch them starve to death first.
Come.	Come on.
Come hither, captain.	Come here, captain.
Hark.	Listen.
I’ll do ’t, my lord.	I’ll do it, sir.
About it, and write “happy” when thou’st done.	When you’ve finished, you’ll be a happy man.
Mark, I say, instantly, and carry it so As I have set it down.	Go immediately, and do exactly as I wrote down.
I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats.	I can’t pull a cart or eat dried oats like a horse.
If it be man’s work, I’ll do ’t.	If it’s work for a man, I’ll do it.
I do require them of you, so to use them As we shall find their merits and our safety May equally determine.	tody of them so I can do what’s best out of concern for their honor and the safety of the kingdom.
With him I sent the queen, My reason all the same, and they are ready Tomorrow or at further space t' appear Where you shall hold your session.	I sent the French queen with him too, for the same reason.
The question of Cordelia and her father Requires a fitter place.	We need a more appropriate place to discuss Cordelia and her father.
I hold you but a subject of this war, Not as a brother.	I’m sorry, sir, but in this war I consider you a subordinate, not my equal.
That’s as we list to grace him.	That’s for to me to decide.
Not so hot.	Not so fast.
In his own grace he doth exalt himself More than in your addition.	He has distinguished himself as a great soldier in his own right, deserving more than any honor your can bestow on him.
That were the most if he should   husband you.	He’d really be your proxy if he married you.
That eye that told you so looked but asquint.	You’re so infatuated with him that you’re hallucinating.
Mean you to enjoy him then?	Are you trying to sleep with him?
Nor in thine, lord.	Nor is it up to you, my lord.
Half-blooded fellow, yes.	Yes it is, you half-blood.
Stay yet.	Hang on a second.
An interlude!	What a farce!
Thou art armed, Gloucester.	You’ve got a sword, Gloucester.
Let the trumpet sound.	Blow the trumpets.
Sick, oh, sick!	Oh, I’m sick, sick!
My sickness grows upon me.	I feel sicker and sicker.
She is not well.	She’s not feeling well.
Convey her to my tent.	Take her to my tent.

What news?	What’s the news?
O, know, my name is lost.	I’ve lost my name and title to a traitor.
Yet am I noble as the adversary I come to cope withal.	But I’m as noble as my opponent.
Which is that adversary?	And who is that?
What’s he that speaks for Edmund, Earl of Gloucester?	Who’s the spokesman for Edmund, Earl of Gloucester?
Himself.	I’m my own spokesman.
What sayst thou to him?	What do you have to say to me?
Behold: it is the privilege of mine honors, My oath, and my profession.	Here’s mine.
In wisdom I should ask thy name.	Normally I would ask you what your name is first.
Back do I toss these treasons to thy head, With the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart—	still fight you and embed your lies back in your hellish heart.—Trumpets, blow!
This is practice, Gloucester.	You were tricked into fighting, Gloucester.
By th' law of arms thou wast not bound to answer An unknown opposite.	According to the laws of war, you didn’t have to fight a stranger.
The laws are mine, not thine.	I make the laws, not you.

What you have charged me with, that have I done— And more, much more.	I’ve done everything you accuse me of—and more, much more.
The time will bring it out.	You’ll find out everything in due time.
Tis past, and so am I.	It’s all over now, and so am I.  Let’s forgive each other.
I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund.	I’m no less noble than you are, Edmund.
If more, the more thou’st wronged me.	If I’m more noble than you, you’ve done me wrong.
My name is Edgar, and thy father’s son.	My name is Edgar, and I’m your father’s son.
The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices Make instruments to plague us.	The gods are fair, and they use our little vices to punish us.
Thou’st spoken right.	You’re right.
Tis true.	That’s true.
I must embrace thee.	Let me embrace you.
Let sorrow split my heart if ever I Did hate thee or thy father.	I swear I never hated you or your father!
Worthy prince, I know ’t.	I know, prince.
Where have you hid yourself?	Where have you been hiding?
How have you known the miseries of your father?	How did you know what happened to your poor father?
List a brief tale, And when ’tis told, oh, that my heart would burst!	Listen to my little story, and when it’s done, oh, my heart will break!
The bloody proclamation to escape, That followed me so near—O our lives' sweetness,	To escape the decree condemning me
And in this habit Met I my father with his bleeding rings, Their precious stones new lost, became his guide, Led him, begged for him, saved him from despair.	I became his guide, I led him and begged for him, and kept him from suicide.
Never—O fault!—revealed myself unto him Until some half-hour past, when I was armed.	I never—oh, what a mistake!—revealed myself to him until half an hour ago, when I was in my armor.
But his flawed heart— Alack, too weak the conflict to support— 'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief, Burst smilingly.	But his frail heart, too weak to grapple with such a conflict between joy and sadness, gave out.
This speech of yours hath moved me, And shall perchance do good.	Your words have moved me, and maybe it’ll do some good.
But speak you on.	But go on.
You look as you had something more to say.	You look like you have something more to say.
If there be more, more woeful, hold it in.	If there’s anything more sorrowful left to add, keep it to yourself.
For I am almost ready to dissolve, Hearing of this.	I’m almost ready to break down hearing this much.
This would have seemed a period To such as love not sorrow, but another To amplify too much would make much more And top extremity.	This may have seemed like the pinnacle of sadness, but if I went on I could outdo it.
Twice then the trumpets sounded, And there I left him tranced.	Then I heard the trumpets blow twice, and left him there in a trance.
But who was this?	But who was that man?
Kent, sir, the banished Kent, who in disguise Followed his enemy king and did him service Improper for a slave.	It was Kent, sir, the exiled Kent, who, after the king treated him like an enemy of the state, put on a disguise and followed his king, carrying out tasks unworthy of even a slave.
Help, help, O, help!	Help, help, oh, help!
What kind of help?	What kind of help do you need?
Speak, man.	Say something, man!
What means that bloody knife?	What is that bloody knife?
Tis hot, it smokes.	It’s still warm from the cut.
It came even from the heart of—oh, she’s dead!	It was just removed from from the heart of—oh, she’s dead!
Who dead?	Who’s dead?
Speak, man.	Speak, man.
Your lady, sir, your lady.	Your wife, sir, your wife.
And her sister By her is poisoned.	And her sister’s dead too, poisoned by your wife.
She confesses it.	She confessed.
I was contracted to them both.	I was engaged to both of them.
All three Now marry in an instant.	All three of us will marry now in death.
Here comes Kent.	Here comes Kent.
I thought the king had more affected the Duke of Albany than Cornwall.	I thought the king preferred the Duke of Albany to the Duke of Cornwall.
It did always seem so to us.	We used to think so too.
But now in the division of the kingdom, it appears not which of the dukes he values most, for equalities are so weighed that curiosity in neither can make choice of either’s moiety.	But the way he’s divided the kingdom recently, nobody can tell which of the dukes he favors more.
His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge.	Yes, I’ve been responsible for his upbringing.
I have so often blushed to acknowledge him that now I am brazed to it.	I’ve had to acknowledge that he’s my son so many times that now I can do it without embarrassment.
Do you smell a fault?	Do you smell something naughty?
I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so proper.	Well, I wouldn’t want to undo the naughtiness, since the boy turned out so well.
But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year older than this, who yet is no dearer in my account.	But I have a legitimate son a few years older than this one, and I don’t love him any more than I love my bastard.
Oh, is this he?	Oh, is that Kent?
I am come To bid my king and master aye good night.	I’ve come to say farewell to my king and master.
Is he not here?	Isn’t he here?
Great thing of us forgot!— Speak, Edmund, where’s the king?	What an enormous thing for us to forget!—Edmund, tell us, where’s the king?
And where’s Cordelia?— Seest thou this object, Kent?	And where’s Cordelia?— Do you see this, Kent?
Alack, why thus?	Oh, why is this so?
Yet Edmund was beloved.	Still, Edmund was beloved.
The one the other poisoned for my sake, And after slew herself.	One of the sisters poisoned the other out of love for me, and then killed herself.
Even so.—Cover their faces.	Apparently so.—Cover their faces.
I pant for life.	I wish I could live longer.
Some good I mean to do Despite of mine own nature.	I want to do a little good despite my evil nature.
Quickly send— Be brief in it—to th' castle, for my writ Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia.	Go quickly—hurry—to the castle, for I’ve given orders to have Lear and Cordelia killed.
Nay, send in time!	Hurry, send someone immediately!
Run, run, O, run!	Run, run, oh, run!
To who, my lord?—Who hath the office?	Whom should we look for in the castle?—Whose job is it?
Send Thy token of reprieve.	Send something along to prove you’re withdrawing the orders.
Well thought on.	Good idea.
Take my sword.	Take my sword.
The captain— Give it the captain.	The captain—give it to the captain.
Haste thee for thy life.	Run as if your life depended on it.
He hath commission from thy wife and me To hang Cordelia in the prison and To lay the blame upon her own despair, That she fordid herself.	My wife and I ordered him to hang Cordelia in prison and then to make it look as if she committed suicide in despair.
The gods defend her!—hear him hence awhile.	Heaven help her!—Get him out of here for now.
Howl, howl, howl, howl!	Howl, howl, howl, howl!
Oh, you are men of stones.	Oh, you men are made of stone!
Had I your tongues and eyes, I’d use them so That heaven’s vault should crack.	If I were you with eyes and a tongue to speak with, I’d crack heaven wide open with my laments!
She’s gone forever.	She’s gone forever.
I know when one is dead and when one lives.	I know how to tell when someone is alive or dead.
She’s dead as earth.	She’s as dead as the cold ground.
Lend me a looking-glass.	Let me borrow a mirror.
If that her breath will mist or stain the stone, Why then, she lives.	If her breath steams up the glass, then she’s alive.
Or image of that horror?	Or just a foretaste of it?
Fall and cease.	Let the world collapse around us.
This feather stirs.	This feather moved because of her breath.
She lives.	She’s alive.
If it be so, It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows That ever I have felt.	If that’s true, it makes up for all the sorrows I’ve ever known.
O my good master!	Oh, my good master!
Prithee, away.	Please, go away.
Tis noble Kent, your friend.	It’s noble Kent, your friend.
A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!	Curse you all, you’re all murderers and traitors!
I might have saved her.	I could have saved her.
Now she’s gone for ever.— Cordelia, Cordelia, stay a little.	Now she’s gone forever.—Cordelia, Cordelia, stay a while.
Ha?	Ha?
Tis true, my lords, he did.	It’s true, my lords, he did.
Did I not, fellow?	Didn’t I?
I am old now, And these same crosses spoil me.	But I’m old now, and suffering has weakened me.
This a dull sight.	My vision is dull.
Are you not Kent?	Aren’t you Kent?
The same.	That’s me.
Your servant Kent.	Your servant Kent.
Where is your servant Caius?	Where’s your servant
He’s a good fellow, I can tell you that.	He’s a good fellow, I can tell you that much.
He’s dead and rotten.	He’s dead and rotting in the dirt now.
No, my good lord.	No, my lord, that was me.
I am the very man— I’ll see that straight.	I’m the one who— I’ll get right on that.
That from your first of difference and decay Have followed your sad steps.	followed you on your sad wanderings, ever since your bad luck began.
You’re welcome hither.	Nice to see you.
Nor no man else.	It was me, no one else.
All’s cheerless, dark, and deadly.	Everything is gloomy, dark, and dreadful.
Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves, And desperately are dead.	Your eldest daughters destroyed themselves and died in despair.
Ay, so I think.	Yes, I think that’s true.
He knows not what he says, and vain it is That we present us to him.	He doesn’t know what he’s saying.
Edmund is dead, my lord.	Edmund is dead, my lord.
For us, we will resign During the life of this old majesty To him our absolute power.	As for me, I’m surrendering all my power over to him, giving him absolute authority for the rest of his life.
He faints!—My lord, my lord!	And my poor  He’s fainted.—My lord, my lord!
Vex not his ghost.	Don’t disturb his soul.
O, let him pass.	Let it go up to heaven.
Oh, he is gone indeed.	Oh, he’s really gone.
The wonder is he hath endured so long.	What’s amazing is how long he lasted.
Bear them from hence.	Carry them away.
Our present business Is to general woe.	Our business now is mourning and grief.
Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?	Why are you hiding that letter?
I know no news, my lord.	I don’t have any news to report, my lord.
What paper were you reading?	What’s that paper you were reading?
Nothing, my lord.	It’s nothing, my lord.
No?	No?
What needed, then, that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket?	Then why did you have to stick it in your pocket in such a hurry?
The quality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself.	If it were nothing, you wouldn’t need to hide it.
I beseech you, sir, pardon me.	Please, sir, I beg you.
It is a letter from my brother that I have not all o'er-read.	It’s a letter from my brother that I haven’t finished reading yet.
Give me the letter, sir.	Give me that letter, sir.
I shall offend, either to detain or give it.	Now I’ll offend you whether I give it to you or not.
The contents, as in part I understand them, are to blame.	The problem is in what the letter says, as far as I can tell.
I hope, for my brother’s justification, he wrote this but as an essay or taste of my virtue.	I hope for my brother’s sake that he just wrote it to test my honor.
I have a journey, sir, shortly to go.	I will have to go on a journey to death soon, sir.
My master calls me.	My master’s calling me.
I must not say no.	I can’t say no.
The weight of this sad time we must obey.	We must remember the gravity of this sad day.
Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.	We should speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.
Come to me, that of this I may speak more.	Come talk to me about this.
If our father would sleep till I waked him, you should enjoy half his revenue forever, and live the beloved of your brother,       Edgar.”  Hum, conspiracy?	If our father were dead you’d receive half of his revenue forever, and you’d have my undying love,      Edgar.” Hmm, what’s this, a conspiracy?
Had he a hand to write this, a heart and brain to breed it in?	How could he have even entertained these thoughts in his heart?
When came this to you?	How did you get this letter?
Who brought it?	Who delivered it?
It was not brought me, my lord.	Nobody delivered it, my lord.
There’s the cunning of it.	That’s what’s clever about it.
I found it thrown in at the casement of my closet.	It was tossed into the window of my room.
You know the character to be your brother’s?	You’re sure the handwriting is your brother’s?
If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear it were his.	If he’d written nice things, I’d swear yes right away.
But in respect of that, I would fain think it were not.	But as it stands, I wish I could believe it wasn’t.
It is his.	But it is his handwriting?
It is his hand, my lord, but I hope his heart is not in the contents.	It’s his handwriting, my lord, but I hope he didn’t mean what he wrote.
Has he never before sounded you in this business?	Has he ever tested out these ideas on you before?
Never, my lord.	Never, my lord.
But I have heard him oft maintain it to be fit that, sons at perfect age and fathers declined, the father should be as ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue.	But I’ve often heard him argue that when sons are at their prime and their fathers are declining, the sons should be their fathers' guardians and manage their fathers' money.
O villain, villain!	Oh, what a villain!
His very opinion in the letter!	That’s just what he said in the letter.
Abhorred villain!	Evil villain!
Go, sirrah, seek him.	Go look for him.
I’ll apprehend him.	I’ll arrest him.
Abominable villain!	Horrid villain!
Where is he?	Where is he?
I do not well know, my lord.	I’m not sure, my lord.
I dare pawn down my life for him that he hath wrote this to feel my affection to your honor and to no other pretense of danger.	I’ll bet my life that he only wrote this letter to gauge my love for you, and for no other reason.
Think you so?	Do you think so?
He cannot be such a monster— Nor is not, sure.	He can’t possibly be such a monster— And I’m sure he isn’t.
To his father, that so tenderly and entirely loves him.	toward his own father who loves him so completely.
Heaven and earth!	Oh, God!
Edmund, seek him out, wind me into him, I pray you.	Edmund, go find him.
I will seek him, sir, presently, convey the business as I shall find means, and acquaint you withal.	I’ll find him right away, sir, and carry out the business as well as I can.
These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us.	These recent eclipses of the sun and moon don’t bode well for us.
Though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects.	Though science can explain them away, disasters still come after eclipses.
Love cools, friendship falls off, brothers divide, in cities	Love cools off, friendships break up, and brothers become enemies.
mutinies, in countries discord, in palaces treason, and the bond cracked ’twixt son and father.	break out, civil war erupts, kings are betrayed, and the bond between father and son snaps.
This villain of mine comes under the prediction—there’s son against father.	This wicked son of mine confirms the prediction —son against father.
The king falls from bias of nature—there’s father against child.	The king acts unnaturally—father against child.
We have seen the best of our time.	We’ve seen the best our age has to offer.
Machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves.	Conspiracies, fakery, betrayal, and disorder are all that’s left until we die.
Find out this villain, Edmund.	Find out what this villainous Edgar is thinking, Edmund.
It shall lose thee nothing.	You won’t lose any respect.
Do it carefully.—And the noble and true-hearted Kent banished, his offense honesty!	Just do it carefully.—And to think that the noble and loyal Kent has been banished, for the crime of telling the truth!
Tis strange, strange.	It’s strange, strange.
This is the excellent foppery of the world that when we are sick in fortune—often the surfeit of our own behavior—we make guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars, as if we were villains by necessity, fools by heavenly compulsion, knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical predominance, drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforced obedience of planetary influence, and all that we are evil in by a divine thrusting-on.	This is a classic example of the idiocy of the world: when we’re down and out—often because of our own excesses —we put all the blame on the sun, the moon, and the stars, as if they forced us to be bad, or the heavens compelled us to be villainous or stupid.
My father compounded with my mother under the dragon’s tail and my nativity was under Ursa Major, so that it follows I am rough and lecherous.	My father and mother coupled when the demonic moon was descending, and I was born under the Big Dipper, so it’s inevitable that I’m rude and oversexed.
Fut, I should have been that I am, had the maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing.	I would have been what I am even if the most virginal star in the heavens had twinkled at my conception.
Fa, sol, la, mi.	Fa, sol, la, mi.
How now, brother Edmund?	Hello, brother Edmund.
What serious contemplation are you in?	What are you thinking about so seriously?
How long have you been a sectary astronomical?	How long have you believed in astrology?
Come, come.	Come on.
When saw you my father last?	When was the last time you saw my father?
Why, the night gone by.	Why, last night.
Spake you with him?	Did you speak to him?
Ay, two hours together.	Yes, we talked for a couple of hours.
Parted you in good terms?	Did you leave on good terms?
Found you no displeasure in him by word or countenance?	Did he express any dissatisfaction with you, either in his words or his face?
None at all.	No, none at all.
Some villain hath done me wrong.	Some villain has told lies about me.
That’s my fear.	That’s what I’m afraid of.
I pray you, have a continent forbearance till the speed of his rage goes slower.	I suggest you lay low until his rage cools a little.
And as I say, retire with me to my lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my lord speak.	In the meantime, come home with me, and when the time is right I’ll take you to talk to him.
Pray ye, go.	Please go.
There’s my key.	Here’s my key.
If you do stir abroad, go armed.	If you go outside, arm yourself.
Armed, brother?	Arm myself?
Brother, I advise you to the best.	Brother, I’m giving you good advice.
Go armed.	Arm yourself.
Pray you, away.	Now please go.
Shall I hear from you anon?	Will I hear from you soon?
I do serve you in this business.	I’ll help you through this business.
A credulous father, and a brother noble— Whose nature is so far from doing harms That he suspects none, on whose foolish honesty My practices ride easy.	A gullible father and a brother who’s so innocent that he can’t suspect anyone else of wanting to hurt him—these are the two fools I need for my plan to work.
I see the business.	I know exactly how to proceed.
Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit.	If I can’t have an estate by birthright, then I’ll get it by being clever.
All with me’s meet that I can fashion fit.	Any trick that works is good for me.
Did my father strike my gentleman For chiding of his fool?	Did my father hit one of my attendants for scolding his fool?
Ay, madam.	Yes, ma'am.
By day and night he wrongs me.	He constantly offends me.
Every hour He flashes into one gross crime or other That sets us all at odds.	Every hour he comes out with some horrible new offense that puts us all on edge.
I’ll not endure it.	I won’t stand for it.
His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us On every trifle.	His knights are getting out of control, and he himself reprimands us about every little detail.
When he returns from hunting, I will not speak with him.	When he comes back from hunting, I’m not going to speak to him.
Say I am sick.	Tell him I’m sick.
If you come slack of former services, You shall do well.	And if you’re not as attentive in serving him as you used to be, that’ll be good.
The fault of it I’ll answer.	I’ll take responsibility for it.
He’s coming, madam.	He’s coming, ma'am.
I hear him.	I hear him.
Put on what weary negligence you please, You and your fellow servants.	Be as lazy and neglectful as you like around him—you and the other servants.
If he distaste it, let him to our sister, Whose mind and mine I know in that are one, Not to be overruled.	If he doesn’t like it, he can go live with my sister.
Idle old man That still would manage those authorities That he hath given away!	That useless old man still thinks he can wield all the powers he’s given away.
Now by my life, Old fools are babes again and must be used With checks as flatteries, when they are seen abused.	I swear, old fools become like babies again.
Remember what I have said.	Remember what I’ve told you.
Very well, madam.	Very well, ma'am.
And let his knights have colder looks among you.	And make sure the servants are less friendly to his knights.
What grows of it, no matter.	Don’t worry about the consequences.
Advise your fellows so.	Tell your men as much.
I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall, That I may speak.	I want this to provoke confrontations, so I can give him a piece of my mind.
I’ll write straight to my sister To hold my very course.	I’ll write to my sister and tell her my plans.
Go, prepare for dinner.	Now go, set up for dinner.
If but as well I other accents borrow, That can my speech diffuse, my good intent May carry through itself to that full issue For which I razed my likeness.	If I can disguise my voice as well as my appearance, then I’ll be able to carry out my plan perfectly.
Now, banished Kent, If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemned, So may it come thy master, whom thou lovest, Shall find thee full of labors.	I love my master, and he’ll find me very hard-working.
Let me not stay a jot for dinner.	Don’t make me wait for dinner even a moment.
Go get it ready.	Get it ready immediately.
A man, sir.	A man, sir.
What dost thou profess?	What’s your profession?
What wouldst thou with us?	What do you want from me?
What art thou?	But who are you?
A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the king.	An honest guy who’s as poor as the king.
If thou beest as poor for a subject as he’s for a king, thou'rt poor enough.	If you’re as poor a subject as he is a king, you definitely are poor.
What wouldst thou?	What do you want?
Service.	To work as a servant.
Who wouldst thou serve?	Who do you want to work for?
You.	You.
Dost thou know me, fellow?	Do you know me?
Authority.	Authority.
What services canst thou do?	What work can you do?
I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious tale in telling it, and deliver a plain message bluntly.	I can be discreet in honorable matters, ride a horse, run, tell a good story badly, and deliver a plain message bluntly.
That which ordinary men are fit for, I am qualified in.	I’m good at everything that ordinary men can do.
And the best of me is diligence.	The best thing about me is that I’m hardworking.
How old art thou?	How old are you?
Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor so old to dote on her for anything.	Not young enough to fall in love with a woman because she sings well, but not old enough to dote on a woman for any reason.
I have years on my back forty- eight.	I’m forty-eight.
Follow me.	Follow me.
Thou shalt serve me.	You’ll work for me.
Where’s my knave, my fool?—Go you, and call my fool hither.	Where’s my fool?—Go call my fool and have him come here.
No, my lord.	No, I don’t, my lord.
My services to your lordship.	Very pleased to meet you, my lord.
I must love you and sue to know you better.	I look forward to getting to know you better.

So please you— What says the fellow there?	I beg your pardon, sir— What did that guy say?
Call the clotpoll back.	Call the numbskull back in here.
Where’s my fool, ho?	Where’s my fool?
I think the world’s asleep.	You’d think everyone was asleep.
How now?	So what’s going on?
Where’s that mongrel?	Where’s that dog?
He says, my lord, your daughter is not well.	He says your daughter’s not feeling well, my lord.
Why came not the slave back to me when I called him.	Why didn’t the jerk come back to me when I called him?
Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner he would not.	Sir, he told me quite bluntly that he didn’t feel like it.
He would not?	Didn’t feel like it?
My lord, I know not what the matter is, but to my judgment your highness is not entertained with that ceremonious affection as you were wont.	My lord, I don’t know what’s going on, but it seems to me that your highness isn’t being treated as politely as before.
There’s a great abatement of kindness appears as well in the general dependants as in the duke himself also, and your daughter.	The servants, the duke, and your daughter all seem to be treating you less kindly.
Ha!	Huh!
Sayest thou so?	Do you really mean that?
I beseech you pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken—for my duty cannot be silent when I think your highness wronged.	Please forgive me if I’m mistaken, my lord—but I can’t keep quiet when I think you’re being insulted.
Thou but rememberest me of mine own conception.	No, you’re just reminding me of something I’ve also noticed.
I have perceived a most faint neglect of late, which I have rather blamed as mine own jealous curiosity than as a very pretense and purpose of unkindness.	I’ve felt neglected recently, but I decided that it was more likely that I was being hypersensitive than that they were intentionally unkind.
I will look further into ’t.	I’ll look into it further.
But where’s my fool?	But where’s my fool?
I have not seen him this two days.	I haven’t seen him for two days.
Since my young lady’s going into France, sir, the fool hath much pined away.	Ever since Cordelia left for France, sir, the fool has been depressed.
No more of that.	Let’s not talk about it.
I have noted it well.	I’ve noticed it myself.
Go you and tell my daughter I would speak with her.	Go and tell my daughter I want to speak with her.
Go you, call hither my fool.	And you, go call my fool.
O you sir, you, come you hither, sir.	You there, sir, come here please.
Who am I, sir?	Who am I, sir?
You slave, you cur!	You scoundrel!
I am none of these, my lord.	You lowlife son-of-a-bitch!
I beseech your pardon.	You dog, you peasant!
I’ll not be strucken, my lord.	I won’t be hit, my lord.
Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee.	Now, my friendly servant, thank you.
Let me hire him too.—Here’s my coxcomb.	Wait, let me hire him too.—Here’s my fool’s cap, a token of my gratitude.
How now, my pretty knave?	Well hello, my good boy.
How dost thou?	How are you doing?
Why, Fool?	Why, Fool?
Why?	Why?
For taking one’s part that’s out of favor.	For standing up for this unpopular king.
Nay, an thou canst not smile as the wind sits, thou'lt catch cold shortly.	No, if you can’t adjust to political changes, you’ll suffer for it.
There, take my coxcomb.	There, take my fool’s cap.
Why, this fellow has banished two on ’s daughters, and did the third a blessing against his will.	This guy here has banished two of his daughters and blessed the third one without intending to.
If thou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb.—How now, nuncle?	If you work for him, you’re a fool and should wear a fool’s cap.—So how’s it going, uncle?
Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters.	I wish I had two fool’s caps and two daughters.
Why, my boy?	Why, my boy?
If I gave them all my living, I’d keep my coxcombs myself.	If I gave them all I own, I’d have two fool’s caps for myself.
There’s mine.	Here’s mine.
Beg another of thy daughters.	Ask your daughters for another one.
Take heed, sirrah—the whip.	Watch out, boy—remember I can whip you.
A pestilent gall to me!	A constant pain to me!
Sirrah, I’ll teach thee a speech.	I’ll recite something for you, guy.

Have more than you show, Speak less than you know, Lend less than you owe.
This is nothing, Fool.	It’s nothing.
Then ’tis like the breath of an unfee’d lawyer.	In that case it’s like the words of an unpaid lawyer.
Why no, boy.	Why, no, boy.
Nothing can be made out of nothing.	Nothing can be made out of nothing.
A bitter fool.	You’re a bitter fool.
Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between a bitter fool and a sweet fool?	Do you know the difference, my boy, between a bitter fool and a sweet one?

Dost thou call me fool, boy?	The sweet fool in a fool’s costume—that’s me.
All thy other titles thou hast given away that thou wast born with.	The bitter one is the other one—that’s you.LEAR Are you calling me a fool, boy?
This is not altogether fool, my lord.	Well, you’ve given away all your other rightful titles.
No, faith, lords and great men will not let me.	No.
What two crowns shall they be?	Which two crowns would those be?
Why—after I have cut the egg i' th' middle and eat up the meat—the two crowns of the egg.	Well, when I cut the egg in half and eat the whites, the yolk will be in two parts like two golden crowns.

When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?	When did you become so fond of singing, boy?
I have used it, nuncle, ever since thou madest thy daughters thy mothers.	I’ve been singing ever since you made your daughters into your mothers by giving them all your power.
For when thou gavest them the rod, and put’st down thine own breeches,            Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to lie.	That’s when you gave them the spanking paddle and pulled your pants down,            Please, uncle, hire a teacher who can teach your fool to lie.
I would fain learn to lie.	I want to learn how to lie.
An you lie, sirrah, we’ll have you whipped.	If you lie, boy, we’ll have you whipped.
I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are.	I’m amazed how similar you and your daughters are.
They’ll have me whipped for speaking true, thou'lt have me whipped for lying, and sometimes I am whipped for holding my peace.	They want to whip me for telling the truth, you want to whip me for lying, and sometimes I’m even whipped for keeping quiet.
I had rather be any kind o' thing than a fool.	I’d rather be anything besides a fool.
And yet I would not be thee, nuncle.	And yet I wouldn’t want to be you, uncle.
Here comes one o' the parings.	Here comes the owner of one piece.
How now, daughter?	What’s going on, daughter?
What makes that frontlet on?	Why are you frowning like that?
Methinks you are too much of late i' th' frown.	I think you’ve been frowning too much recently.
He that keeps nor crust nor crumb,  Weary of all, shall want some.	The man who gives away his crust and his crumbs Will discover that he needs some crumbs back.

Which else were shame, that then necessity Will call discreet proceeding.	However, this is an extreme situation, and it’s more important to control it than to worry about how you’ll look.
For you know, nuncle, The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long, That it’s had it head bit off by it young.	You know, uncle, A sparrow once raised a cuckoo in its nest Until the cuckoo grew up and bit the sparrow’s head off.

This admiration, sir, is much o' th' savor Of other your new pranks.	This fake astonishment of yours is just like your other pranks.
I do beseech you To understand my purposes aright.	I’m asking you to understand my point of view.
As you are old and reverend, should be wise.	Since you’re old and respected, you should be wise.
Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires, Men so disordered, so debauched and bold That this our court, infected with their manners, Shows like a riotous inn.	But you’re keeping a hundred knights here who are so disorderly, vulgar, and obnoxious that our noble court is starting to look like a noisy cheap hotel.
Epicurism and lust Make it more like a tavern or a brothel Than a graced palace.	They’re such oversexed gluttons that I feel like we’re living in a pub or a whorehouse rather than a respectable palace.
The shame itself doth speak For instant remedy.	It’s shameful, and we have to make some changes right away.
Darkness and devils!	Hell and damnation!
Saddle my horses.	Saddle up my horses.
Call my train together.— Degenerate bastard, I’ll not trouble thee.	Call my knights together.
Yet have I left a daughter.	You’re not really my daughter, but I still have one daughter left.
You strike my people, and your disordered rabble Make servants of their betters.	You hit my servants, and your disorderly mob of knights treat their superiors like servants.
Woe that too late repents!—   Is it your will?	You’ll be sorry later, but it’ll be too late.
Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend, More hideous when thou show’st thee in a child Than the sea monster.	Ingratitude is always hideous, but an ungrateful child is uglier than a sea monster!

Speak.	Tell me.
Now gods that we adore, whereof comes this?	Dear gods in heaven, what’s the reason for this?
Thou shalt find That I’ll resume the shape which thou dost think I have cast off for ever.	And then you’ll see that despite what you thought, I’ll be as powerful as I was before.
Thou shalt, I warrant thee.	You’ll see, I promise you.
Do you mark that, my lord?	Did you hear that?
I cannot be so partial, Goneril, To the great love I bear you—      Pray you, content.	Goneril, you know how much I love you, but still I have to say— Shush, please.
Come, sire, no more.—What, Oswald, ho!	Come, sir, no more.—Oswald, come here!
A fox when one has caught her And such a daughter Should sure to the slaughter, If my cap would buy a halter.	A fox you’ve trapped And such a daughter Should both be slaughtered, If my fool’s cap is worth a rope to bind them.
So the fool follows after.	So the fool follows you.
This man hath had good counsel—a hundred knights!	My father can’t think straight—a hundred knights!
Well, you may fear too far.	You may be exaggerating the risks.
Safer than trust too far.	That’s better than exaggerating our trust.
Let me still take away the harms I fear, Not fear still to be taken.	It’s always better to get rid of what you’re scared of than to be afraid.
I know his heart.	I know how his mind works.
What he hath uttered I have writ my sister.	I’ve written to my sister telling her everything he’s said.
If she sustain him and his hundred knights When I have showed th' unfitness— Here, madam.	If she welcomes him and his hundred knights after I’ve shown how inappropriately he’s behaved— Here, ma'am.
How now, Oswald?	Well, Oswald?
What, have you writ that letter to my sister?	Have you written that letter to my sister yet?
Ay, madam.	Yes, ma'am.
Take you some company, and away to horse.	Take some men and horses and go to her.
Inform her full of my particular fear, And thereto add such reasons of your own As may compact it more.	Add details of your own to back up what I’m saying.
Get you gone And hasten your return.	Now go, and hurry back.
Striving to better, oft we mar what’s well.	But people often screw things up trying to make them better.

Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly.	Your other daughter Regan will treat you kindly, you’ll see.
For though she’s as like this as a crab’s like an apple, yet I can tell what I can tell.	Even though she’s as similar to Goneril as one crabapple is like another, still… I know what I know.
Why, what canst thou tell, my boy?	And what do you know, boy?
She will taste as like this as a crab does to a crab.	I know that Regan will taste just like Goneril—both of them sour crabapples.
Thou canst tell why one’s nose stands i' th' middle on ’s face?	Do you know why the nose is in the middle of a person’s face?
No.	No.
Why, to keep one’s eyes of either side ’s nose, that what a man cannot smell out, he may spy into.	Why, to keep the eyes on the sides, so that you can see anything that you can’t sniff out.
I did her wrong— Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?	I was wrong to her— Do you know how an oyster makes its shell?
No.	No.
Nor I neither.	Me neither.
But I can tell why a snail has a house.	But I know why a snail carries its house on its back.
Why?	Why?
Why, to put ’s head in—not to give it away to his daughters and leave his horns without a case.	He can’t give his house away to his daughters, leaving himself without shelter.
I will forget my nature.	I want to forget what I am.
So kind a father!—Be my horses ready?	Such a kind father!—Are my horses ready?
Thy asses are gone about 'em.	Your attendant asses are getting the horses ready.
The reason why the seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason.	There’s a nice reason why the constellation Pleiades has only seven stars in it.
Because they are not eight?	Because it doesn’t have eight?
Yes indeed.	That’s right.
Thou wouldst make a good fool.	You’d make a good fool.
To take ’t again perforce— Monster ingratitude!	I could take back my crown by force—What outrageous ingratitude!

Save thee, Curan.	Hello, Curan.
And you, sir.	Hello, sir.
I have been with your father and given him notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan his duchess will be here with him this night.	I just saw your father the Lord Gloucester and notified him that the Duke of Cornwall and his wife Regan will stay with him here tonight.
How comes that?	Why is that?
Nay, I know not.	I don’t know.
Have you heard of no likely wars toward ’twixt the two Dukes of Cornwall and Albany?	You haven’t heard of the war brewing between the Dukes of Cornwall and Albany?
Not a word.	Not a word.
You may do then in time.	You may hear about it soon.
Fare you well, sir.	Goodbye, sir.

This weaves itself perforce into my business.	His arrival fits perfectly into my plan.
Briefness and fortune, work!— Brother, a word.	Fast work and a little luck are all I need.—Brother, could I have a word with you?
Descend, brother, I say.	Come down, brother.
My father watches.	Father is on the lookout.
O sir, fly this place.	Get out of here quickly!
Intelligence is given where you are hid.	It has leaked out that you’re hiding here.
Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall aught?	You haven’t said anything against the Duke of Cornwall, have you?
He’s coming hither—now, i' th' night, i' th' haste, And Regan with him.	He’s rushing on his way here right now, and Regan’s with him.
Advise yourself.	Think about it.
I hear my father coming.	I hear my father coming.
Pardon me.	Forgive me.

Now quit you well.—             Torches, torches!	Be convincing.
Now Edmund, where’s the villain?	Edmund, where’s your wicked brother?
Look, sir, I bleed.	Look, sir, I’m bleeding.
Where is the villain, Edmund?	Where is the villain, Edmund?

Go after.	Go.
By no means” what?	When he couldn’t what?
Sir, in fine, Seeing how loathly opposite I stood To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion, With his preparèd sword he charges home My unprovided body, latched mine arm.	In short, when I told him how firmly opposed I was to his hideous plan, he pulled out his sword and lunged at my defenseless body, cutting my arm.
And when he saw my best alarumed spirits, Bold in the quarrel’s right, roused to the encounter, Or whether ghasted by the noise I made, Full suddenly he fled.	Bolstered by righteousness, I prepared to fight, and when he saw my excitement—or perhaps because my shouting scared him—he ran away suddenly.
Let him fly far.	Let him run far away.
Not in this land shall he remain uncaught.	If he stays in this country he’ll be found.
The noble duke my master, My worthy arch and patron, comes tonight.	The Duke of Cornwall, my master and patron, is arriving tonight.
And find I am alone felicitate In your dear highness' love.	joy except my love for you, and I find that only your majesty’s love makes me happy.

I love your majesty According to my bond, no more nor less.	I love you as a child should love her father, neither more nor less.
How, how, Cordelia?	What are you saying, Cordelia?
Mend your speech a little, Lest you may mar your fortunes.	Revise your statement, or you may damage your inheritance.
He that conceals him, death.	justice will be rewarded.
He replied, “Thou unpossessing bastard!	He answered, “You penniless bastard!
Dost thou think If I would stand against thee, would the reposal Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee Make thy words faithed?	Do you really think that if it came down to my word against yours, anyone would believe you?
No.	No.
What I should deny— As this I would, ay, though thou didst produce My very character—I’d turn it all To thy suggestion, plot, and damnèd practice.	I’d deny whatever evidence you had against me—even if it were in my own handwriting—and turn it all into evidence against you and your plans for treachery.
And thou must make a dullard of the world, If they not thought the profits of my death Were very pregnant and potential spirits To make thee seek it.”    O strange and fastened villain!	And you must think people are stupid if you believe they wouldn’t realize all the motives you have for trying to kill me.” Oh, how monstrously evil!
Would he deny his letter, said he?	He said he would deny that he wrote his letter?
I never got him.— Hark, the duke’s trumpets.	The duke’s trumpets.
I know not why he comes.	I don’t know why he’s come here.
All ports I’ll bar.	I’ll forbid all ships from leaving our harbors.
The villain shall not ’scape.	The villain won’t escape.
The duke must grant me that.	The duke will agree with me on that.
How now, my noble friend?	How are you, my friend?
Since I came hither, Which I can call but now, I have heard strange news.	Ever since I arrived here, just now, I’ve been hearing strange rumors.

I know not, madam.	I don’t know, madam.
Tis too bad, too bad.	Oh, it’s too terrible.
Yes, madam, he was of that consort.	To answer your question, ma'am—yes, he was friendly with those knights.
No marvel then, though he were ill affected.	Then it’s no surprise they had a bad influence on him.
Tis they have put him on the old man’s death, To have th' expense and spoil of his revenues.	They probably put him up to killing old man Gloucester to get his money.
I have this present evening from my sister Been well informed of them—and with such cautions That if they come to sojourn at my house I’ll not be there.	Tonight I received a letter from my sister telling me all about them—and warning me not be at home in case they come to stay at my house.
Nor I, assure thee, Regan.— Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father A childlike office.	And I won’t be there either.—Edmund, I’m told you’ve acted like a true son to your father.
It was my duty, sir.	I just did my duty, sir.
He did bewray his practice, and received This hurt you see striving to apprehend him.	He exposed Edgar’s murderous plot, and was wounded, as you see there, when trying to apprehend him.
Is he pursued?	Are your men searching for him?
Ay, my good lord.	Yes, my lord.

I' th' mire.	In the mud.
Prithee, if thou lovest me, tell me.	Please, sir, be kind to me and tell me.
I love thee not.	I won’t be kind to you.
Why, then, I care not for thee.	In that case, I don’t much care for you either.
If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold, I would make thee care for me.	If I could get my hands on you, I’d make you care.
Why dost thou use me thus?	Why are you talking to me like this?
I know thee not.	I don’t even know you.
Fellow, I know thee.	Ah, but I know you.

Draw, you rascal.	Draw your sword, you jerk!
You come with letters against the king and take Vanity the puppet’s part against the royalty of her father.	You come here with letters against the king, and you take his conceited daughter’s side against his royal highness.

Most royal sir, Fleance is ’scaped.	Most royal sir, Fleance has escaped.

I had else been perfect, Whole as the marble, founded as the rock, As broad and general as the casing air.	Otherwise I would have been perfect, as solid as a piece of marble, as firm as a rock, as free as the air itself.
Ay, my good lord.	Yes, my good lord.

This is the very painting of your fear.	This is just another one of the hallucinations you always get when you’re afraid.
This is the air-drawn dagger which you said Led you to Duncan.	These outbursts of yours don’t even look like real fear.
Oh, these flaws and starts, Impostors to true fear, would well become A woman’s story at a winter’s fire, Authorized by her grandam.	They’re more like how you would act if you were a woman telling a scary story by the fireside in front of her grandmother.
Shame itself!	Shame on you!
Why do you make such faces?	Why are you making these faces?
When all’s done, You look but on a stool.	When the vision passes, you’ll see that you’re just looking at a stool.

If you will take a homely man’s advice, Be not found here.	If you’ll take a simple man’s advice, don’t be here when it arrives.

To fright you thus methinks I am too savage; To do worse to you were fell cruelty, Which is too nigh your person.	I feel bad for scaring you like this, but it would be much worse for me to let you come to harm.
Heaven preserve you!	And harm is getting close!

Each new morn New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds As if it felt with Scotland and yelled out Like syllable of dolor.	Each day new widows howl, new orphans cry, and new sorrows slap heaven in the face, until it sounds like heaven itself feels Scotland’s anguish and screams in pain.
What you have spoke, it may be so perchance.	What you just said may perhaps be true.
This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues, Was once thought honest.	This tyrant, whose mere name is so awful it hurts us to say it, was once considered an honest man.
You have loved him well.	You were one of his favorites.
He hath not touched you yet.	He hasn’t done anything to harm you yet.
I am young, but something You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom To offer up a weak, poor, innocent lamb T' appease an angry god.	It would be smart to offer someone poor and innocent like me as a sacrificial lamb to satisfy an angry god like Macbeth.

Bleed, bleed, poor country!	Bleed, bleed, poor country!
I would not be the villain that thou think’st For the whole space that’s in the tyrant’s grasp, And the rich East to boot.	I wouldn’t be the villain you think I am even if I were offered all of Macbeth’s kingdom and the riches of the East too.
Be not offended.	Don’t be offended.
I speak not as in absolute fear of you.	I don’t completely distrust you.
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke.	I do think Scotland is sinking under Macbeth’s oppression.
It weeps, it bleeds, and each new day a gash Is added to her wounds.	Our country weeps, it bleeds, and each day a fresh cut is added to her wounds.

What should he be?	Who are you talking about?
Not in the legions Of horrid hell can come a devil more damned In evils to top Macbeth.	Even in hell you couldn’t find a devil worse than Macbeth.

It hath been The untimely emptying of the happy throne And fall of many kings.	It has caused the downfall of many kings.
But fear not yet To take upon you what is yours.	But don’t be afraid to take the crown that belongs to you.
We have willing dames enough.	There are more than enough willing women around.
This avarice Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been The sword of our slain kings.	Greed has been the downfall of many kings.
But I have none.	But I don’t have any good sides.
Nay, had I power, I should Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell, Uproar the universal peace, confound All unity on earth.	No, if I had power I would take world peace and throw it down to hell.

I cannot but remember such things were That were most precious to me.	I can’t help remembering the things that were most precious to me.
Did heaven look on, And would not take their part?	Did heaven watch the slaughter and not send down any help?
Sinful Macduff, They were all struck for thee!	Sinful Macduff, they were killed because of you!
Naught that I am, Not for their own demerits, but for mine, Fell slaughter on their souls.	As wicked as I am, they were slaughtered because of me, not because of anything they did.
Heaven rest them now.	May God give their souls rest.
Be this the whetstone of your sword.	Let this anger sharpen your sword.
Let grief Convert to anger.	Transform your grief into anger.
Oh, I could play the woman with mine eyes And braggart with my tongue!	I could go on weeping like a woman and bragging about how I will avenge them!
But, gentle heavens, Cut short all intermission.	But gentle heavens, don’t keep me waiting.
Front to front Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself.	Bring me face to face with Macbeth, that devil of Scotland.
Within my sword’s length set him; if he ’scape, Heaven forgive him too.	Put him within the reach of my sword, and if he escapes, may heaven forgive him as well!
This tune goes manly.	Now you sound like a man.
Come, go we to the king.	Come on, let’s go see King Edward.
Our power is ready; Our lack is nothing but our leave.	The army is ready.
Macbeth Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above Put on their instruments.	Macbeth is ripe for the picking.
Receive what cheer you may.	Cheer up as much as you can.
I have two nights watched with you but can perceive no truth in your report.	I’ve stayed up with you for two nights now, and I haven’t seen any evidence of what you were talking about.
When was it she last walked?	When was the last time you saw her sleepwalking?
Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen her rise from her bed, throw her nightgown upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it, write upon ’t, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.	Since Macbeth went to war, I have seen her rise from her bed, put on her nightgown, unlock her closet, take out some paper, fold it, write on it, read it, seal it up, and then return to bed, remaining asleep the entire time.
In this slumbery agitation, besides her walking and other actual performances, what, at any time, have you heard her say?	When she is like this, besides walking and performing various activities, have you heard her say anything?
That, sir, which I will not report after her.	She says something, sir, but I will not repeat it to you.
Neither to you nor any one, having no witness to confirm my speech.	I will not confess it to you nor to anyone else, because there was no one else to witness her speech.
Lo you, here she comes.	Look, here she comes!
This is her very guise; and, upon my life, fast asleep.	This is exactly how she always looks, and—I swear it—she is fast asleep.
Observe her, stand close.	Watch her.
How came she by that light?	How did she get that candle?
Why, it stood by her.	It stands by her bedside.
She has light by her continually.	She always has to have a light next to her.
Tis her command.	Those are her orders.
You see her eyes are open.	You see, her eyes are open.
Ay, but their sense is shut.	Yes, but they don’t see anything.
What is it she does now?	What’s she doing now?
Look, how she rubs her hands.	Look how she rubs her hands.
It is an accustomed action with her to seem thus washing her hands.	She looks like she’s washing her hands.
Yet here’s a spot.	There’s still a spot here.
Hark!	Listen!
She speaks.	She’s talking.
I will set down what comes from her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.	I’ll write down what she says, so I’ll remember it better.
Do you mark that?	Did you hear that?
The thane of Fife had a wife.	The thane of Fife had a wife.
Where is she now?—What, will these hands ne'er be clean?—No more o' that, my lord, no more o' that.	Where is she now?—What, will my hands never be clean?—No more of that, my lord, no more of that.
You have known what you should not.	You’ve heard something you shouldn’t have.
She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of that.	She said something she shouldn’t have said, I’m sure of that.
Heaven knows what she has known.	Heaven knows what secrets she’s keeping.
Here’s the smell of the blood still.	I still have the smell of blood on my hand.
All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand.	All the perfumes of Arabia couldn’t make my little hand smell better.
Oh, Oh, Oh!	Oh, oh, oh!
What a sigh is there!	What a heavy sigh!
The heart is sorely charged.	Her heart is carrying a heavy weight.
I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body.	I wouldn’t want a heart like hers even if you made me queen.
Well, well, well.	Well, well, well.
Pray God it be, sir.	I hope what she’s saying is well, sir!
This disease is beyond my practice.	This disease is beyond my medical skills.
Yet I have known those which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in their beds.	But I have known people who sleepwalked and weren’t guilty of anything.
Wash your hands.	Wash your hands.
Put on your nightgown.	Put on your nightgown.
Even so?	Is this true?
To bed, to bed.	To bed, to bed!
There’s knocking at the gate.	There’s a knocking at the gate.
Will she go now to bed?	Will she go to bed now?
God, God forgive us all!	Yes, right away.
Good night, good doctor.	Unnatural acts will cause  Good night, good doctor.
The English power is near, led on by Malcolm, His uncle Siward and the good Macduff.	The English army is near, led by Malcolm, his uncle Siward, and the good Macduff.
Revenges burn in them, for their dear causes Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm Excite the mortified man.	They burn for revenge.
Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?	Does anyone know if Donalbain is with his brother?
For certain, sir, he is not.	He is definitely not there, sir.
I have a file Of all the gentry.	I have a list of all the important men.
What does the tyrant?	What is the tyrant Macbeth doing?
Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.	He is fortifying his castle at Dunsinane with heavy defenses.
But, for certain, He cannot buckle his distempered cause Within the belt of rule.	One thing is certain: he’s out of control.
Who then shall blame His pestered senses to recoil and start, When all that is within him does condemn Itself for being there?	Who can blame him for acting crazy, when inside he condemns himself for everything he’s done?
Make we our march towards Birnam.	Let’s proceed on our march to Birnam.
Silenced with that, In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day, He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks, Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make, Strange images of death.	He was also shocked to learn that on the same day you fought the rebels you also fought against the army of Norway, and that you weren’t the least bit afraid of death, even as you killed everyone around you.
As thick as tale Can post with post, and every one did bear Thy praises in his kingdom’s great defense, And poured them down before him.	Messenger after messenger delivered news of your bravery to the king with praise for how you defended his country.
We are sent To give thee from our royal master thanks, Only to herald thee into his sight, Not pay thee.	The king sent us to give you his thanks and to bring you to him.
Why do you dress me In borrowed robes?	Why are you giving me his title?
Whether he was combined With those of Norway, or did line the rebel With hidden help and vantage, or that with both He labored in his country’s wrack, I know not; But treasons capital, confessed and proved, Have overthrown him.	I don’t know whether he fought on Norway’s side, or if he secretly aided the rebels, or if he fought with both of our enemies.
Bring me no more reports.	Don’t bring me any more reports.
Till Birnam Wood remove to Dunsinane I cannot taint with fear.	Until Birnam Wood gets up and moves to Dunsinane, I won’t be affected by fear.
What’s the boy Malcolm?	What’s the boy Malcolm?
Was he not born of woman?	Wasn’t he born from a woman?
The spirits that know All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus: “Fear not, Macbeth.	The spirits that know the future have told me this: “Don’t be afraid, Macbeth.
No man that’s born of woman Shall e'er have power upon thee.” Then fly, false thanes, And mingle with the English epicures.	No man born from a woman will ever defeat you.” So get out of here, disloyal thanes, and join the weak and decadent English!
The mind I sway by and the heart I bear Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.	My mind and courage will never falter with doubt or shake with fear.
The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!	May the devil turn you black, you white-faced fool!
Where got’st thou that goose look?	Why do you look like a frightened goose?
There is ten thousand— Geese, villain?	There are ten thousand— Geese, you idiot?
Soldiers, sir.	Soldiers, sir.
Go, prick thy face and over-red thy fear, Thou lily-livered boy.	Go pinch your cheeks and bring some color back into your face, you cowardly boy.
What soldiers, patch?	What soldiers, fool?
Death of thy soul!	Curse you!
Those linen cheeks of thine Are counselors to fear.	That pale face of yours will frighten the others as well.
What soldiers, whey-face?	What soldiers, milk-face?
The English force, so please you.	The English army, sir.
Take thy face hence.	Get out of my sight.
Seyton!—I am sick at heart, When I behold—Seyton, I say!—This push Will cheer me ever, or disseat me now.	Seyton!—I’m sick at heart when I see—Seyton, come here!—This battle will either secure my reign forever or else topple me from the throne.
I have lived long enough.	I have lived long enough.
Seyton!	Seyton!
What’s your gracious pleasure?	What do you want?
What news more?	Is there more news?
All is confirmed, my lord, which was reported.	All the rumors have been confirmed.
I’ll fight till from my bones my flesh be hacked.	I’ll fight until they hack the flesh off my bones.
Give me my armor.	Give me my armor.
Tis not needed yet.	You don’t need it yet.
I’ll put it on.	I’ll put it on anyway.
Send out more horses.	Send out more cavalry.
Give me mine armor.	Give me my armor.
Not so sick, my lord, As she is troubled with thick-coming fancies That keep her from her rest.	She is not sick, my lord, but she is troubled with endless visions that keep her from sleeping.
Cure her of that.	Cure her of that.
Therein the patient Must minister to himself.	For that kind of relief, the patient must heal herself.
Throw physic to the dogs; I’ll none of it.	Medicine is for the dogs.
Come, put mine armor on.	I won’t have anything to do with it.
Ay, my good lord.	Yes, my good lord.
Your royal preparation Makes us hear something.	Your preparation for war sounds like something.
Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand That chambers will be safe.	Kinsmen, I hope the time is coming when people will be safe in their own bedrooms.
We doubt it nothing.	We don’t doubt it.
What wood is this before us?	What’s the name of this forest behind us?
The wood of Birnam.	Birnam Wood.
Let every soldier hew him down a bough And bear ’t before him.	Tell every soldier to break off a branch and hold it in front of him.
Thereby shall we shadow The numbers of our host and make discovery Err in report of us.	That way we can conceal how many of us there are, and Macbeth’s spies will give him inaccurate reports.
It shall be done.	We’ll do it.
We learn no other but the confident tyrant Keeps still in Dunsinane and will endure Our setting down before ’t.	We shouldn’t make any judgments until we achieve our goal.
Hang out our banners on the outward walls.	Hang our flags on the outer walls.
The cry is still “They come!” Our castle’s strength Will laugh a siege to scorn.	Everyone keeps yelling, “Here they come!” Our castle is strong enough to laugh off their seige.
Here let them lie Till famine and the ague eat them up.	They can sit out there until they die of hunger and disease.
Were they not forced with those that should be ours, We might have met them dareful, beard to beard, And beat them backward home.	If it weren’t for the fact that so many of our soldiers revolted and joined them, we could have met them out in front of the castle, man to man, and beaten them back to England.
What is that noise?	What’s that noise?
It is the cry of women, my good lord.	It’s women crying, my good lord.
I have almost forgot the taste of fears.	I’ve almost forgotten what fear feels like.
The time has been my senses would have cooled To hear a night-shriek, and my fell of hair Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir As life were in ’t.	There was a time when I would have been terrified by a shriek in the night, and the hair on my skin would have stood up when I heard a ghost story.
Wherefore was that cry?	What was that cry for?
The queen, my lord, is dead.	The queen is dead, my lord.
She should have died hereafter.	She would have died later anyway.
Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, Creeps in this petty pace from day to day To the last syllable of recorded time, And all our yesterdays have lighted fools The way to dusty death.	Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow.
Out, out, brief candle!	Out, out, brief candle.
It is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.	Life is a story told by an idiot, full of noise and emotional disturbance but devoid of meaning.
Gracious my lord, I should report that which I say I saw, But know not how to do ’t.	My gracious lord, I should tell you what I saw, but I don’t know how to say it.
Well, say, sir.	Just say it.
As I did stand my watch upon the hill, I looked toward Birnam, and anon methought The wood began to move.	As I was standing watch on the hill, I looked toward Birnam, and I thought I saw the forest begin to move.
Liar and slave!	Liar and slave!
Let me endure your wrath, if ’t be not so.	Punish me if it’s not true.
Within this three mile may you see it coming; I say, a moving grove.	Three miles from here you can see it coming, a moving forest.
If thou speak’st false, Upon the next tree shall thou hang alive Till famine cling thee.	If you’re lying, I’ll hang you alive from the nearest tree until you die of hunger.
If thy speech be sooth, I care not if thou dost for me as much.	If what you say is true, you can do the same to me.
Now near enough.	We’re close enough now.
Fare you well.	Good luck.
Do we but find the tyrant’s power tonight, Let us be beaten if we cannot fight.	If we meet Macbeth’s army tonight, let us be beaten if we cannot fight.
They have tied me to a stake.	They have me tied to a stake.
I cannot fly, But, bearlike, I must fight the course.	I can’t run away.
What’s he That was not born of woman?	You’ll be afraid to hear it.
Such a one Am I to fear, or none.	No I won’t, even if you were one of the worst demons in hell.
What is thy name?	My name’s Macbeth.
Thou 'lt be afraid to hear it.	The devil himself couldn’t say a name I hate more.
No, though thou call’st thyself a hotter name Than any is in hell.	No, nor could the devil’s name be more frightening.
My name’s Macbeth.	You lie, you disgusting tyrant.
The devil himself could not pronounce a title More hateful to mine ear.	I’ll prove with my sword that I’m not scared of you.
No, nor more fearful.	You were born from a woman.
Thou liest, abhorrèd tyrant.	Swords don’t frighten me.
But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn, Brandished by man that’s of a woman born.	I laugh at any weapon used by a man who was born from a woman.
But ’tis strange.	But this whole thing is strange.
That way the noise is.	The noise is coming from over there.
Tyrant, show thy face!	Tyrant, show your face!
Either thou, Macbeth, Or else my sword with an unbattered edge I sheathe again undeeded.	I’ll either fight you, Macbeth, or else I’ll put down my sword unused.
There thou shouldst be; By this great clatter, one of the greatest note Seems bruited.	You must be over there.
This way, my lord.	Come this way, my lord.
The castle’s gently rendered.	Our noblemen are battling bravely.
Enter, sir, the castle.	Sir, enter the castle.
Turn, hellhound, turn!	Turn around, you dog from hell, turn around!
But get thee back.	But go away now.
I have no words.	I have nothing to say to you.
My voice is in my sword.	My sword will talk for me.
Thou bloodier villain Than terms can give thee out!	You are too evil for words!
As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed.	You might as well try to stab the air with your sword.
Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests; I bear a charmèd life, which must not yield To one of woman born.	I lead a charmed life, which can’t be ended by anyone born from a woman.
I’ll not fight with thee.	I won’t fight you.
Then yield thee, coward, And live to be the show and gaze o' th' time.	Then surrender, coward, and we’ll put you in a freakshow, just like they do with deformed animals.
We’ll have thee, as our rarer monsters are, Painted on a pole, and underwrit, “Here may you see the tyrant.”      I will not yield, To kiss the ground before young Malcolm’s feet, And to be baited with the rabble’s curse.	We’ll put a picture of you on a sign, right above the words “Come see the tyrant!” I’m not going to surrender and have to kiss the ground in front of Malcolm, or be taunted by the common people.
Though Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinane, And thou opposed, being of no woman born, Yet I will try the last.	Even though Birnam Wood really did come to Dunsinane, and I’m fighting a man not of woman born, I’ll fight to the end.
Before my body I throw my warlike shield.	I’ll put up my shield and battle you.
Lay on, Macduff, And damned be him that first cries, “Hold, enough!” I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.	Come on, let’s go at it, Macduff, and damn the first man who cries, 'Stop!
Some must go off.	Enough!
Macduff is missing, and your noble son.	Macduff is missing, and so is your noble son.
Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier’s debt.	My lord, your son has paid the soldier’s price: death.
He only lived but till he was a man, The which no sooner had his prowess confirmed In the unshrinking station where he fought, But like a man he died.	He only lived long enough to become a man, and as soon as he proved that he was a man by fighting like one, he died.
Then he is dead?	So he’s dead?
Ay, and brought off the field.	Yes, and he’s been carried off the field.
Your cause of sorrow Must not be measured by his worth, for then It hath no end.	Your grief should not be equal to his worth, because then your sorrow would never end.
Had he his hurts before?	Were his wounds on his front side?
Ay, on the front.	Yes, on his front.
Why then, God’s soldier be he!	Well then, he’s God’s soldier now!
Had I as many sons as I have hairs, I would not wish them to a fairer death.	If I had as many sons as I have hairs on my head, I couldn’t hope that any of them would die more honorably than he did.
And so, his knell is knolled.	And that’s all there is to it.
He’s worth more sorrow, And that I’ll spend for him.	He is worth more mourning than that, and I will mourn for him.
He’s worth no more.	He is worth no more than that.
They say he parted well and paid his score.	They tell me he died well, and settled his scores.
And so, God be with him!	With that, I hope God is with him!
Here comes newer comfort.	Here comes better news.
Hail, king!	Hail, king!
For so thou art.	Because that’s what you are now.
Behold where stands The usurper’s cursèd head.	Look, here I have Macbeth’s cursed head.
The time is free.	We are free from his tyranny.
Hail, King of Scotland!	Hail, King of Scotland!
My thanes and kinsmen, Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland In such an honor named.	My thanes and kinsmen, I name you all earls, the first earls that Scotland has ever had.
So, thanks to all at once and to each one, Whom we invite to see us crowned at Scone.	So I thank you all, and I invite each and every one of you to come watch me be crowned king of Scotland at Scone.
Look how our partner’s rapt.	Look at Macbeth—he’s in a daze.
Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.	Good Macbeth, we’re ready when you are.
Kind gentlemen, your pains Are registered where every day I turn The leaf to read them.	Kind gentlemen, I won’t forget the trouble you’ve taken for me whenever I think of this day.
Let us toward the king.	Let’s go to the king.
Very gladly.	Absolutely.
Till then, enough.	Until then, we’ve said enough.
My liege, They are not yet come back.	My king, they haven’t come back yet.
But I have spoke With one that saw him die, who did report That very frankly he confessed his treasons, Implored your highness' pardon, and set forth A deep repentance.	But I spoke with someone who saw Cawdor die, and he said that Cawdor openly confessed his treasons, begged your highness’s forgiveness, and repented deeply.
Nothing in his life Became him like the leaving it.	He never did anything in his whole life that looked as good as the way he died.
He died As one that had been studied in his death To throw away the dearest thing he owed As ’twere a careless trifle.	He died like someone who had practiced how to toss away his most cherished possession as if it were a worthless a piece of garbage.
There’s no art To find the mind’s construction in the face.	There’s no way to read a man’s mind by looking at his face.
Welcome hither.	You are welcome here.
So humbly take my leave.	With that, I’ll be off.
My worthy Cawdor!	My worthy Cawdor!
When shall we three meet again?	When should the three of us meet again?
In thunder, lightning, or in rain?	Will it be in thunder, lightning, or rain?
That will be ere the set of sun.	That will happen before sunset.
Where the place?	Where should we meet?
There to meet with Macbeth.	We’ll meet Macbeth there.
What thou wouldst highly, That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false, And yet wouldst wrongly win.	When I tried desperately to question them further, they vanished into thin air.
Thou'ld’st have, great Glamis, That which cries, “Thus thou must do,” if thou have it, And that which rather thou dost fear to do, Than wishest should be undone.	While I stood spellbound, messengers from the king arrived and greeted me as the thane of Cawdor, which is precisely how the weird sisters had saluted me before calling me ’the future king!
What is your tidings?	What news do you bring?
The king comes here tonight.	The king is coming here tonight.
Thou 'rt mad to say it.	You must be crazy to say that!
One of my fellows had the speed of him, Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more Than would make up his message.	He sent a messenger ahead of him who arrived here so out of breath that he could barely speak his message.
Give him tending.	Take good care of him.
He brings great news.	He brings great news.
My dearest love, Duncan comes here tonight.	My dearest love, Duncan is coming here tonight.
And when goes hence?	And when is he leaving?
Tomorrow, as he purposes.	He plans to leave tomorrow.
O, never Shall sun that morrow see!	That day will never come.
Your face, my thane, is as a book where men May read strange matters.	Your face betrays strange feelings, my lord, and people will be able to read it like a book.
Bear welcome in your eye, Your hand, your tongue.	Greet the king with a welcoming expression in your eyes, your hands, and your words.
Look like th' innocent flower, But be the serpent under ’t.	You should look like an innocent flower, but be like the snake that hides underneath the flower.
We will speak further.	We will speak about this further.
Leave all the rest to me.	Leave all the rest to me.
This castle hath a pleasant seat.	This castle is in a pleasant place.
The air Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself Unto our gentle senses.	The air is sweet and appeals to my refined senses.
This guest of summer, The temple-haunting martlet, does approve, By his loved mansionry, that the heaven’s breath Smells wooingly here.	The fact that this summer bird, the house martin, builds his nests here proves how inviting the breezes are.
No jutty, frieze, Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle.	There isn’t a single protrusion in the castle walls where these birds haven’t built their hanging nests to sleep and breed.
Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed, The air is delicate.	I’ve noticed that they always like to settle and mate where the air is the nicest.
See, see, our honored hostess!	Look, here comes our honored hostess!
The love that follows us sometime is our trouble, Which still we thank as love.	Sometimes the love my subjects bring me is inconvenient, but I still accept it as love.
Fair and noble hostess, We are your guest tonight.	Fair and noble hostess, we are your guests tonight.
Your servants ever Have theirs, themselves, and what is theirs in compt, To make their audit at your highness' pleasure, Still to return your own.	We are your servants, your highness, and as always our house and everything in it is at your disposal, for after all, we keep it in your trust and we’re glad to give you back what’s yours.
Give me your hand.	Give me your hand.
Conduct me to mine host.	Bring me to my host, Macbeth.
We love him highly And shall continue our graces towards him.	I love him dearly, and I shall continue to favor him.
By your leave, hostess.	Whenever you’re ready, hostess.
If it were done when ’tis done, then ’twere well It were done quickly.	If this business would really be finished when I did the deed, then it would be best to get it over with quickly.
What news?	What news do you have?
He has almost supped.	He has almost finished dinner.
Why have you left the chamber?	Why did you leave the dining room?
Hath he asked for me?	Has he asked for me?
Know you not he has?	Don’t you know he has?
We will proceed no further in this business.	We can’t go on with this plan.
He hath honored me of late, and I have bought Golden opinions from all sorts of people, Which would be worn now in their newest gloss, Not cast aside so soon.	The king has just honored me, and I have earned the good opinion of all sorts of people.
Was the hope drunk Wherein you dressed yourself?	Were you drunk when you seemed so hopeful before?
From this time Such I account thy love.	From now on this is what I’ll think of your love.
Art thou afeard To be the same in thine own act and valor As thou art in desire?	Are you afraid to act the way you desire?
Wouldst thou have that Which thou esteem’st the ornament of life, And live a coward in thine own esteem, Letting “I dare not” wait upon “I would, ” Like the poor cat i' th' adage?	You’re like the poor cat in the old story.
What beast was ’t, then, That made you break this enterprise to me?	If you weren’t a man, then what kind of animal were you when you first told me you wanted to do this?
What not put upon His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt Of our great quell?	And whatever we do, we can lay all the blame on the drunken servants.
Bring forth men-children only, For thy undaunted mettle should compose Nothing but males.	May you only give birth to male children, because your fearless spirit should create nothing that isn’t masculine.
Will it not be received, When we have marked with blood those sleepy two Of his own chamber and used their very daggers, That they have done ’t?	Once we have covered the two servants with blood, and used their daggers to kill, won’t people believe that they were the culprits?
Away, and mock the time with fairest show.	Go now, and pretend to be a friendly hostess.
False face must hide what the false heart doth know.	Hide with a false pleasant face what you know in your false, evil heart.
How goes the night, boy?	How’s the night going, boy?
The moon is down.	The moon has set.
I have not heard the clock.	The clock hasn’t struck yet.
And she goes down at twelve.	The moon sets at twelve, right?
I take ’t ’tis later, sir.	I think it’s later than that, sir.
Hold, take my sword.	Here, take my sword.
There’s husbandry in heaven; Their candles are all out.	The heavens are being stingy with their light.
Take thee that too.	Take this, too.
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me, And yet I would not sleep.	I’m tired and feeling heavy, but I can’t sleep.
Merciful powers, Restrain in me the cursèd thoughts that nature Gives way to in repose.	Merciful powers, keep away the nightmares that plague me when I rest!
Give me my sword.	Give me my sword.
Who’s there?	Who’s there?
A friend.	A friend.
What, sir, not yet at rest?	You’re not asleep yet, sir?
The king’s a-bed.	The king’s in bed.
He hath been in unusual pleasure, and Sent forth great largess to your offices.	He’s been in an unusually good mood and has granted many gifts to your household and servants.
This diamond he greets your wife withal, By the name of most kind hostess, and shut up In measureless content.	This diamond is a present from him to your wife for her boundless hospitality.
Being unprepared, Our will became the servant to defect, Which else should free have wrought.	Because we were unprepared for the king’s visit, we weren’t able to entertain him as well as we would have wanted to.
What bloody man is that?	Who is this bloody man?
He can report, As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt The newest state.	Judging from his appearance, I bet he can tell us the latest news about the revolt.
This is the sergeant Who like a good and hardy soldier fought 'Gainst my captivity.	This is the brave sergeant who fought to keep me from being captured.
Hail, brave friend!	Hail, brave friend!
Say to the king the knowledge of the broil As thou didst leave it.	Tell the king what was happening in the battle when you left it.
Doubtful it stood, As two spent swimmers that do cling together And choke their art.	The armies were like two exhausted swimmers clinging to each other and struggling in the water, unable to move.
O valiant cousin!	My brave relative!
Worthy gentleman!	What a worthy man!
All’s well.	Everything’s OK.
I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters: To you they have showed some truth.	I had a dream last night about the three witches.
I think not of them.	I don’t think about them now.
Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve, We would spend it in some words upon that business, If you would grant the time.	But when we have an hour to spare we can talk more about it, if you’re willing.
At your kind’st leisure.	Whenever you like.
If you shall cleave to my consent, when ’tis, It shall make honor for you.	If you stick with me, when the time comes, there will be something in it for you.
Good repose the while!	Rest easy in the meantime.
Thanks, sir: the like to you!	Thank you, sir.

Is this a dagger which I see before me, The handle toward my hand?	Is this a dagger I see in front of me, with its handle pointing toward my hand?
Whiles I threat, he lives.	I’m going now.
Hear it not, Duncan, for it is a knell That summons thee to heaven or to hell.	Don’t listen to the bell, Duncan, because it summons you either to heaven or to hell.
That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold.	The alcohol that got the servants drunk has made me bold.
What hath quenched them hath given me fire.	The same liquor that quenched their thirst has fired me up.
Hark!	Listen!
Peace!	Quiet!
My husband!	My husband!
I have done the deed.	I have done the deed.
Didst thou not hear a noise?	Did you hear a noise?

Did not you speak?	Didn’t you say something?
When?	When?
Now.	Just now.
As I descended?	As I came down?
Ay.	Yes.
Hark!	Listen!
Who lies i' th' second chamber?	Who’s sleeping in the second chamber?
Donalbain.	Donalbain.
A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.	That’s a stupid thing to say.
One cried, “God bless us!” and “Amen” the other, As they had seen me with these hangman’s hands.	One servant cried, “God bless us!” and the other replied, “Amen,” as if they had seen my bloody hands.
List'ning their fear I could not say “Amen,” When they did say “God bless us!” Consider it not so deeply.	Listening to their frightened voices, I couldn’t reply “Amen” when they said “God bless us!” Don’t think about it so much.
But wherefore could not I pronounce “Amen”?	But why couldn’t I say “Amen”?
I had most need of blessing, and “Amen” Stuck in my throat.	I desperately needed God’s blessing, but the word “Amen” stuck in my throat.
These deeds must not be thought After these ways.	We can’t think that way about what we did.
So, it will make us mad.	If we do, it’ll drive us crazy.
Methought I heard a voice cry, “Sleep no more!	I thought I heard a voice cry, “Sleep no more!
What do you mean?	What are you talking about?
Still it cried, “Sleep no more!” to all the house.	The voice kept crying, “Sleep no more!” to everyone in the house.
Go get some water, And wash this filthy witness from your hand.	Go get some water and wash this bloody evidence from your hands.
Why did you bring these daggers from the place?	Why did you carry these daggers out of the room?
They must lie there.	They have to stay there.
Go carry them and smear The sleepy grooms with blood.	Go take them back and smear the sleeping guards with the blood.
Infirm of purpose!	Coward!
Give me the daggers.	Give me the daggers.
The sleeping and the dead Are but as pictures.	Only children are afraid of scary pictures.
If he do bleed, I’ll gild the faces of the grooms withal, For it must seem their guilt.	If Duncan bleeds I’ll paint the servants' faces with his blood.
Whence is that knocking?	Where is that knocking coming from?
How is ’t with me when every noise appals me?	What’s happening to me, that I’m frightened of every noise?
I hear a knocking At the south entry.	I hear someone knocking at the south entry.
Retire we to our chamber.	Let’s go back to our bedroom.
A little water clears us of this deed.	A little water will wash away the evidence of our guilt.
How easy is it, then!	It’s so simple!
Your constancy Hath left you unattended.	You’ve lost your resolve.
Hark!	Listen!
More knocking.	There’s more knocking.
Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us And show us to be watchers.	Put on your nightgown, in case someone comes and sees that we’re awake.
Be not lost So poorly in your thoughts.	Snap out of your daze.
Wake Duncan with thy knocking.	Wake Duncan with your knocking.
I would thou couldst.	I wish you could!
Knock, knock, knock!	Knock, knock, knock!
Knock, knock!	Knock, knock!
Who’s there, in th' other devil’s name?	Who’s there, in the other devil’s name?
O, come in, equivocator.	Come on in, con man.
Knock, knock, knock!	Knock, knock, knock!
Who’s there?	Who’s there?
Faith, here’s an English tailor come hither for stealing out of a French hose.	Maybe it’s an English tailor who liked to skimp on the fabric for people’s clothes.
Come in, tailor.	Come on in, tailor.
Here you may roast your goose.	You can heat your iron up in here.
Knock, knock!	Knock, knock!
Never at quiet.	Never a moment of peace!
What are you?	Who are you?
But this place is too cold for hell.	Ah, this place is too cold to be hell.
I’ll devil-porter it no further.	I won’t pretend to be the devil’s porter anymore.
Anon, anon!	I’m coming, I’m coming!
I pray you, remember the porter.	Please, don’t forget to leave me a tip.
Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed, That you do lie so late?	Did you go to bed so late, my friend, that you’re having a hard time getting up now?
What three things does drink especially provoke?	What three things does drink make a man do?
Lechery, sir, it provokes and unprovokes.	It sets you up for a fall.
It provokes the desire, but it takes away the performance.	It persuades you and discourages you.
I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.	I believe drink did all of this to you last night.
Is thy master stirring?	Is your master awake?
Our knocking has awaked him.	Our knocking woke him up.
Here he comes.	Here he comes.

Good morrow, both.	Good morning to both of you.
Is the king stirring, worthy thane?	Is the king awake, worthy thane?
Not yet.	Not yet.
He did command me to call timely on him.	He commanded me to wake him up early.
I have almost slipped the hour.	I’ve almost missed the time he requested.
I’ll bring you to him.	I’ll bring you to him.
I know this is a joyful trouble to you, But yet ’tis one.	I know the burden of hosting him is both an honor and a trouble, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a trouble just the same.
The labor we delight in physics pain.	The work we enjoy is not really work.
This is the door.	This is the door.
I’ll make so bold to call, For ’tis my limited service.	I’ll wake him, because that’s my job.
Goes the king hence today?	Is the king leaving here today?
He does.	He is.
He did appoint so.	He told us to arrange it.
The night has been unruly.	The night has been chaotic.
Where we lay, Our chimneys were blown down and, as they say, Lamentings heard i' th' air, strange screams of death, And prophesying with accents terrible Of dire combustion and confused events New hatched to the woeful time.	The wind blew down through the chimneys where we were sleeping.
The obscure bird Clamored the livelong night.	The owl made noise all night.
Some say the Earth Was feverous and did shake.	Some people say that the earth shook as if it had a fever.
Twas a rough night.	It was a rough night.
My young remembrance cannot parallel A fellow to it.	I’m too young to remember anything like it.
O horror, horror, horror!	Oh, horror, horror, horror!
Tongue nor heart cannot conceive nor name thee!	This is beyond words and beyond belief!
What’s the matter?	What’s the matter?
Confusion now hath made his masterpiece.	The worst thing imaginable has happened.
The life”?	The life”?
Mean you his majesty?	Do you mean the king?
Mark, King of Scotland, mark: No sooner justice had, with valor armed, Compelled these skipping kerns to trust their heels, But the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage, With furbished arms and new supplies of men, Began a fresh assault.	Listen to this, King: as soon as we sent those Irish soldiers running for cover, the Norwegian king saw his chance to attack us with fresh troops and shiny weapons.
Dismayed not this our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?	Didn’t this frighten our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?
Yes, as sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.	The new challenge scared them about as much as sparrows frighten eagles, or rabbits frighten a lion.
If I say sooth, I must report they were As cannons overcharged with double cracks, So they doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe.	To tell you the truth, they fought the new enemy with twice as much force as before; they were like cannons loaded with double ammunition.
So well thy words become thee as thy wounds; They smack of honor both.	Your words, like your wounds, bring you honor.
Go get him surgeons.	Take him to the surgeons.
Who comes here?	Who is this?
So should he look That seems to speak things strange.	He looks like someone with a strange tale to tell.
Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight With a new Gorgon.	Go into the bedroom and see for yourself.
Do not bid me speak.	Don’t ask me to talk about it.
See, and then speak yourselves.	Go look and then do the talking yourselves.

Malcolm!	Malcolm!
Banquo!	Banquo!
As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites, To countenance this horror!	Get up from your beds as if you were rising out of your own graves, and walk like ghosts to come witness this horror.
Speak, speak!	Speak up and tell me!
O gentle lady, 'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak: The repetition, in a woman’s ear, Would murder as it fell.	If I repeated it to you, it would kill you as soon as you heard it.
O Banquo, Banquo, Our royal master’s murdered!	Oh Banquo, Banquo, the king has been murdered!
Woe, alas!	How horrible!
What, in our house?	What, in our own house?
Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself, And say it is not so.	Dear Macduff, I beg you, tell us you were lying and say it isn’t so.
Had I but died an hour before this chance, I had lived a blessèd time, for from this instant There’s nothing serious in mortality.	If I had only died an hour before this event I could say I had lived a blessed life.

So were their daggers, which unwiped we found Upon their pillows.	So were their daggers, which we found on their pillows, unwiped.

Who can be wise, amazed, temp'rate, and furious, Loyal and neutral, in a moment?	Is it possible to be wise, bewildered, calm, furious, loyal, and neutral all at once?
Here lay Duncan, His silver skin laced with his golden blood, And his gashed stabs looked like a breach in nature For ruin’s wasteful entrance; there, the murderers, Steeped in the colors of their trade, their daggers Unmannerly breeched with gore.	Then right next to him I saw the murderers, dripping with blood, their daggers rudely covered in gore.
Who could refrain, That had a heart to love, and in that heart Courage to make ’s love known?	Who could have restrained himself, who loved Duncan and had the courage to act on it?
Help me hence, ho!	Help me out of here, quickly!
Look to the lady.	Take care of the lady.
Fears and scruples shake us.	Right now we’re shaken up by fears and doubts.

Now, by two-headed Janus, Nature hath fram'd strange fellows in her time: Some that will evermore peep through their eyes, And laugh, like parrots, at a bag-piper; And other of such vinegar aspect, That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile, Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.	Now, looking at both sides, Nature has made strange fellows in her time: Some that will peep through their eyes forever, And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper, And the others of such sour disposition That they'll never smile Although a wise old man swears that the joke is funny.

Tis not unknown to you, Antonio, How much I have disabled mine estate, By something showing a more swelling port Than my faint means would grant continuance: Nor do I now make moan to be abridg'd From such a noble rate; but my chief care Is to come fairly off from the great debts Wherein my time, something too prodigal, Hath left me gag'd.	You know, Antonio, How much I have wasted my money By putting on a fancier appearance Than my small funds could support; I don’t come to you now to ask that you Forgive my debts, because my chief concern Is to make good on these great debts Which my behavior, sometimes reckless And wasteful, has left me broke.

When I was in school, when I had lost one arrow, I shot another one of identical length In an identical way, with more thoughtful care, To find the one I lost, and by risking both, I often Found both.
I owe you much; and, like a wilful youth, That which I owe is lost: but if you please To shoot another arrow that self way Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt, As I will watch the aim, or to find both, Or bring your latter hazard back again, And thankfully rest debtor for the first.

You know me well, and herein spend but time, To wind about my love with circumstance; And, out of doubt, you do me now more wrong In making question of my uttermost, Than if you had made waste of all I have.	You know me well, and waste time here To twist a story about my friendship with examples; And, no doubt, you insult me By questioning the limits of my friendship As if you had wasted everything I have.

He was wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy; let him look to his bond.	He used to lend money as a favor between Christians; but now, let him think about his own debt.
Why, I am sure, if he forfeit thou wilt not take his flesh.	But you won’t take his flesh if he can’t pay.
What’s that good for?	What’s that good for?
To bait fish withal.	I’ll use it for fish bait.
He hath disgraced me and hindered me half a million, laughed at my losses, mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine enemies—and what’s his reason?	He’s laughed at my losses, made fun of my earnings, humiliated my race, thwarted my deals, turned my friends against me, riled up my enemies—and why?
I am a Jew.	Because I’m a Jew.
Hath not a Jew eyes?	Doesn’t a Jew have eyes?
Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions?	Doesn’t a Jew have hands, bodily organs, a human shape, five senses, feelings, and passions?
Fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a Christian is?	Doesn’t a Jew eat the same food, get hurt with the same weapons, get sick with the same diseases, get healed by the same medicine, and warm up in summer and cool off in winter just like a Christian?
If you prick us, do we not bleed?	If you prick us with a pin, don’t we bleed?
If you tickle us, do we not laugh?	If you tickle us, don’t we laugh?
If you poison us, do we not die?	If you poison us, don’t we die?
And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?	And if you treat us badly, won’t we try to get revenge?
If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that.	If we’re like you in everything else, we’ll resemble you in that respect.
If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility?	If a Jew offends a Christian, what’s the Christian’s kind and gentle reaction?
Revenge.	Revenge.
We have been up and down to seek him.	We’ve been looking for him everywhere.
Here comes another of the tribe.	Here comes another Jew.
A third cannot be matched unless the devil himself turn Jew.	You couldn’t find a third like these two unless the devil himself turned into a Jew.
How now, Tubal?	Hello, Tubal.
What news from Genoa?	Any news from Genoa?
Hast thou found my daughter?	Did you find my daughter?
I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.	I went to many places where I heard news about her, but I couldn’t find her.
Why, there, there, there, there!	Oh, oh, oh!
I never felt it till now—Two thousand ducats in that, and other precious, precious jewels.	I never felt it until now—two thousand ducats in that diamond, and other precious, precious jewels!
I would my daughter were dead at my foot and the jewels in her ear!	I wish my daughter were dead at my feet wearing those jewels!
Would she were hearsed at my foot and the ducats in her coffin!	I wish she were in her coffin here, with the ducats in her coffin!
No news of them?	You couldn’t find out anything about them?
Why, so.	Why?
And I know not what’s spent in the search.	I don’t even know how much I’m spending to find them.
Why thou, loss upon loss!	Loss upon loss!
Yes, other men have ill luck too.	Well, other men have bad luck too.
Antonio, as I heard in Genoa— What, what, what?	Antonio, as I heard in Genoa— What, what, what?
Ill luck, ill luck?	Bad luck, bad luck?
Hath an argosy cast away coming from Tripolis.	He’s had a ship wrecked coming from Tripolis.
I thank God, I thank God!	Thank God, thank God!
Is ’t true, is ’t true?	Is it true, is it true?
I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wrack.	I spoke with some of the sailors who survived the wreck.
I thank thee, good Tubal.	Thank you, Tubal.
Good news, good news!	Good news, good news!
Ha, ha, heard in Genoa.	Ha, ha, heard in Genoa.
Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, in one night fourscore ducats.	I also heard that your daughter spent eighty ducats in Genoa one night.
Thou stickest a dagger in me.	Oh, you’re sticking a dagger in me!
I shall never see my gold again.	I’ll never see my gold again.
Fourscore ducats at a sitting!	Eighty ducats in one shot!
Fourscore ducats!	Eighty ducats!
There came divers of Antonio’s creditors in my company to Venice that swear he cannot choose but break.	I came to Venice with a number of Antonio’s creditors who say he won’t be able to avoid going bankrupt.
I am very glad of it.	I’m very glad about that.
I’ll plague him.	I’ll hound him.
I’ll torture him.	I’ll torture him.
I am glad of it.	I’m very glad.
One of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey.	One creditor showed me a ring he got from your daughter in exchange for a monkey.
Out upon her!	Damn her!
Thou torturest me, Tubal.	You’re torturing me, Tubal.
It was my turquoise.	That was my turquoise ring!
I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor.	Leah gave it to me before we were married.
I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.	I wouldn’t have given it away for a whole jungle of monkeys.
But Antonio is certainly undone.	But Antonio’s certainly ruined.
Nay, that’s true, that’s very true.	That’s true, that’s very true.
Bespeak him a fortnight before.—I will have the heart of him if he forfeit, for were he out of Venice I can make what merchandise I will.—Go, go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue.	With him out of Venice, I can make whatever bargains I want when I lend money.—Go, Tubal.
Go, good Tubal.	Meet me at the synagogue.
At our synagogue, Tubal.	Let me choose now.
Before you hazard, for in choosing wrong I lose your company.	I feel tortured by all this talking.
Therefore forbear awhile.	Tortured,
There may as well be amity and life 'Tween snow and fire, as treason and my love.	They’re as opposite as hot and cold.
Promise me life, and I’ll confess the truth.	Promise me you’ll let me live, and I’ll confess the truth.
Well then, confess and live.	All right then, confess and live.
Confess and love” Had been the very sum of my confession.	Confess and love” is more like it.
But let me to my fortune and the caskets.	But let me try my luck on the boxes.
Away, then.	Go ahead, then.
I am locked in one of them.	I’m locked in one of them.
If you do love me you will find me out.— Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.	If you really love me, you’ll find me.—Nerissa and the rest of you, get away from him.
Let music sound while he doth make his choice.	Play some music while he chooses.
Then if he lose he makes a swanlike end, Fading in music.	Then if he loses, it’ll be his swan song, music before the end.
He may win, And what is music then?	What music should we play then?
The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives, With blearèd visages come forth to view The issue of th' exploit.—Go, Hercules!	We’ve all come out to see what will happen.—Go, Hercules!
Live thou, I live.	If you survive, I’ll live.
With much, much more dismay I view the fight than thou that makest the fray.	I’m more anxious watching you fight than you are in the fight itself.
Ding, dong, bell.	Ding, dong, bell.
How many cowards whose hearts are all as false As stairs of sand wear yet upon their chins The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars, Who, inward searched, have livers white as milk, And these assume but valor’s excrement To render them redoubted.	How many people are cowards at heart but wear beards like Hercules or Mars, the god of war?
So are those crispèd snaky golden locks Which maketh such wanton gambols with the wind, Upon supposèd fairness, often known To be the dowry of a second head, The skull that bred them in the sepulcher.	Curly golden hair moves so nicely in the wind and makes a woman beautiful.
Thus ornament is but the guilèd shore To a most dangerous sea, the beauteous scarf Veiling an Indian beauty—in a word, The seeming truth which cunning times put on To entrap the wisest.	A lovely, cunning shore can distract a man from the perils of a stormy sea, just as a pretty scarf can hide a dangerous dark-skinned beauty.
Therefore then, thou gaudy gold, Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee.	So I’ll have nothing to do with that gaudy gold box—it’s like the gold that Midas couldn’t eat.
Since this fortune falls to you, Be content and seek no new.	Since this prize is yours, Be happy with it, and don’t look for a new one.
If you be well pleased with this And hold your fortune for your bliss, Turn you where your lady is And claim her with a loving kiss.”	If you’re happy with what you’ve won And accept this prize as your blissful destiny, Then turn to where your lady is, And claim her with a loving kiss.”
A gentle scroll.	A nice message.
Fair lady, by your leave, I come by note to give and to receive.	My lady, with your permission, this note authorizes me to give myself to you with a kiss.
Like one of two contending in a prize That thinks he hath done well in people’s eyes, Hearing applause and universal shout, Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt Whether these pearls of praise be his or no— So, thrice fair lady, stand I even so, As doubtful whether what I see be true Until confirmed, signed, ratified by you.	And so, beautiful lady, I’m standing here just like that, wondering whether all this can be true until you tell me it is.
You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand Such as I am.	You see me standing here, Lord Bassanio.
Though for myself alone I would not be ambitious in my wish To wish myself much better, yet for you I would be trebled twenty times myself— A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich— That only to stand high in your account I might in virtue, beauties, livings, friends Exceed account.	Though I wouldn’t wish to be better for my own sake, for your sake I wish I were twenty times more than myself—a thousand times more beautiful and ten thousand times richer—just so you might value me more, so my good qualities, beauty, possessions, and friends would be more than you could calculate.
Happier than this— She is not bred so dull but she can learn.	I’m even happier that I’m not stupid, and I can learn.
Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit Commits itself to yours to be directed As from her lord, her governor, her king.	I’m happiest of all that I’m yours now, my lord, my king, and you can guide me as you wish.
Myself and what is mine to you and yours Is now converted.	Everything I am and everything I have now belongs to you.
But now I was the lord Of this fair mansion, master of my servants, Queen o'er myself.	Just a minute ago I was the owner of this beautiful mansion, master of these servants, and queen over myself.
And even now, but now, This house, these servants, and this same myself Are yours, my lord’s.	But as of right this second all these things are yours.
I give them with this ring, Which when you part from, lose, or give away, Let it presage the ruin of your love	With this ring I give them all to you.
I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it.	Please let me know your plan, Bassanio.
And if it stand, as you yourself still do, Within the eye of honor, be assured My purse, my person, my extremest means Lie all unlocked to your occasions.	As long as it’s honorable, you can be sure that I’ll let you use all my money and do everything I can to help you.
In my school days, when I had lost one shaft, I shot his fellow of the selfsame flight The selfsame way with more advisèd watch To find the other forth—and by adventuring both, I oft found both.	Back when I was a schoolboy, if I lost an arrow I would try to find it by shooting another arrow in the same direction, watching the second arrow more carefully than I had the first.
I urge this childhood proof Because what follows is pure innocence.	By risking the second arrow, I’d often get both of them back.
I owe you much, and, like a willful youth, That which I owe is lost.	I’m telling you this story for a reason.
You know me well, and herein spend but time To wind about my love with circumstance.	I owe you a lot, and like a spoiled kid I’ve lost what I owe you.
And out of doubt you do me now more wrong In making question of my uttermost Than if you had made waste of all I have.	But if you’d be willing to shoot another arrow the same way you shot the first, I’ll watch your arrow more carefully this time.
Then do but say to me what I should do That in your knowledge may by me be done, And I am pressed unto it.	Just tell me what to do, and I’ll do it.
Therefore speak.	Tell me.
O, then be bold to say Bassanio’s dead!	If you see me without it, you can be confident I’m dead.
My lord and lady, it is now our time, That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper, To cry, “Good joy, good joy, my lord and lady!” My Lord Bassanio and my gentle lady, I wish you all the joy that you can wish, For I am sure you can wish none from me.	Now we can shout, “Congratulations, congratulations, my lord and lady!” My Lord Bassanio, and my dear lady, I wish you all the joy I can wish for.
And when your honors mean to solemnize The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you Even at that time I may be married too.	And when you get married, I hope I can be married at the same time.
With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.	Absolutely, if you can find a wife by then.
I thank your lordship, you have got me one.	I think I’ve found one already, thanks to you, my lord.
What, and stake down?	And do you mean what you’re saying, Gratiano?
What, and my old Venetian friend Salerio?	Yes, my lord.
Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither, If that the youth of my new interest here Have power to bid you welcome.	Hey, if I lay down my “ Welcome, Lorenzo and Salerio.
So do I, my lord.	I do too, my lord.
They are entirely welcome.	They’re entirely welcome.
And I have reason for it.	That’s true, and with good reason.
Signor Antonio Commends him to you.	This letter is for you from Signor Antonio.
Ere I ope his letter, I pray you tell me how my good friend doth.	Before I open this letter, please tell me how my good friend is doing.
Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind, Nor well, unless in mind.	He’s not sick, my lord, but he’s very upset, and his problems are serious.
His letter there Will show you his estate.	His letter will tell you how he’s doing.
There are some shrewd contents in yond same paper That steals the color from Bassanio’s cheek.	I wish you’d won the  Something bad in that letter is making Bassanio turn pale.
Some dear friend dead, else nothing in the world Could turn so much the constitution Of any constant man.	Some good friend of his must have died, because nothing else in the world could change a man so much.
What, worse and worse?— With leave, Bassanio, I am half yourself, And I must freely have the half of anything That this same paper brings you.	What, does the news only get worse?—Please, Bassanio, I’m half of you, so let me bear half the burden this letter brings you.
O sweet Portia, Here are a few of the unpleasant’st words That ever blotted paper.	Oh Portia, these are some of the worst words that ever stained a piece of paper.
Gentle lady, When I did first impart my love to you, I freely told you, all the wealth I had Ran in my veins.	My darling, when I gave my love to you, I told you that all the wealth I had ran within my veins—that I have noble blood, but no money.
I was a gentleman, And then I told you true.	When I said that, I told you the truth.
When I told you My state was nothing, I should then have told you That I was worse than nothing, for indeed I have engaged myself to a dear friend, Engaged my friend to his mere enemy To feed my means.	But my dear, when I said I was worth nothing, I was actually bragging—I should’ve said that I was worse than nothing.
Have all his ventures failed?	Have all his business ventures failed?
What, not one hit?	Not even one success?
Not one, my lord.	Not one, my lord.
Besides, it should appear that if he had The present money to discharge the Jew, He would not take it.	Anyway, even if he had the money now, the Jew probably wouldn’t take it.
Never did I know A creature that did bear the shape of man So keen and greedy to confound a man.	I’ve never seen a creature with a human shape who was so eager to destroy a man.
He plies the duke at morning and at night, And doth impeach the freedom of the state If they deny him justice.	He’s at the duke’s morning and night, accusing the state of harming free trade if they deny him justice.
When I was with him I have heard him swear To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen, That he would rather have Antonio’s flesh Than twenty times the value of the sum That he did owe him.	When I was still living with him I heard him swear to Tubal and Cush, his countrymen, that he’d rather have Antonio’s flesh than twenty times the sum Antonio owed.
And I know, my lord, If law, authority, and power deny not, It will go hard with poor Antonio.	And I know that unless the law intervenes, it’ll be bad news for poor Antonio.
Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?	Is this your good friend who’s in so much trouble?
What sum owes he the Jew?	How much does he owe the Jew?
For me, three thousand ducats.	Three thousand ducats.
What, no more?	What, that’s all?
Pay him six thousand and deface the bond!	Pay him six thousand and cancel the debt.
You shall have gold To pay the petty debt twenty times over.	I’ll give you enough gold to pay back your debt twenty times over.
When it is paid, bring your true friend along.	When it’s paid, bring your friend back.
My maid Nerissa and myself meantime Will live as maids and widows.	Until you get back, Nerissa and I will live like virgins and widows.
Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer.	Put on a happy face, and welcome your friends.
But let me hear the letter of your friend.	But let me hear the letter from your friend.
Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all miscarried.	Dear Bassanio, my ships have all been wrecked.
My creditors grow cruel.	My creditors are getting mean.
My estate is very low.	My money’s almost run out.
My bond to the Jew is forfeit.	I couldn’t pay my debt to the Jew on the due date.
Notwithstanding, use your pleasure.	In any case, do what you want.
If your love do not persuade you to come, let not my letter.” O love, dispatch all business and be gone!	If your affection for me doesn’t convince you to come, don’t let my letter do so.” Oh, my darling, make your arrangements and go!
Since I have your good leave to go away, I will make haste.	Since you’re letting me leave, I’ll hurry.
But till I come again, No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay, No rest be interposer ’twixt us twain.	But I won’t sleep till I get back.
Jailer, look to him.	Jailer, watch out for this one.
This is the fool that lent out money gratis.	This is the fool who lent out money without charging interest.
Jailer, look to him.	Jailer, keep an eye on him.
Hear me yet, good Shylock.	Listen to me, good Shylock.
I pray thee, hear me speak.	I’m going to get my  Please, listen to me.
I’ll have my bond.	I want my bond.
I will not hear thee speak.	I won’t listen to you.
I’ll have my bond, and therefore speak no more.	I want my bond, so stop talking.
I’ll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool To shake the head, relent and sigh, and yield To Christian intercessors.	I won’t be taken for a fool who sighs and gives in to Christian meddlers.
Follow not.	Don’t follow me.
I’ll have no speaking.	I’m not talking with you.
I will have my bond.	I want my bond.
It is the most impenetrable cur That ever kept with men.	He’s the most stubborn dog that ever lived among humans.
Let him alone.	Leave him alone.
I’ll follow him no more with bootless prayers.	I won’t follow him around with useless pleas anymore.
He seeks my life.	He wants me dead.
His reason well I know.	I know the real reason.
I oft delivered from his forfeitures Many that have at times made moan to me.	I’ve often given money to people who were unable to pay back their loans to him.
Therefore he hates me.	That’s why he hates me.
I am sure the duke Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.	I’m sure the duke will never allow this contract to be enforced.
Therefore go.	So go.
These griefs and losses have so bated me, That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh Tomorrow to my bloody creditor.— Well, jailer, on.—Pray God Bassanio come To see me pay his debt, and then I care not.	I’ve lost so much weight worrying about my losses have that I’ll hardly have a pound of flesh to spare for my bloody creditor tomorrow.—Well, jailer, let’s go.—I hope to God that Bassanio comes to see me pay his debt.
Lorenzo, I commit into your hands The husbandry and manage of my house Until my lord’s return.	Lorenzo, please take charge of the management of my house until my husband comes back.
Madam, with all my heart.	Madam, with all my heart.
I shall obey you in all fair commands.	I’ll do anything you ask.
My people do already know my mind And will acknowledge you and Jessica In place of Lord Bassanio and myself.	They’ll consider you and Jessica masters of this house in place of Lord Bassanio and myself.
So fare you well till we shall meet again.	So goodbye until we meet again.
Fare you well, Jessica.	Goodbye, Jessica.
Now, Balthazar, As I have ever found thee honest true, So let me find thee still.	Now, Balthazar, you’ve always been honest and faithful to me, and I trust you still are.
Sometimes from her eyes I did receive fair speechless messages.	Sometimes the expression on her face tells me she likes me.
Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued To Cato’s daughter, Brutus' Portia.	Her name is Portia.
I shall be there before thee.	I’ll meet you at the ferry.
Madam, I go with all convenient speed.	I’ll go as fast as I can, madam.
Come on, Nerissa, I have work in hand That you yet know not of.	Come on, Nerissa, I have many things to do that you don’t even know about yet.
We’ll see our husbands Before they think of us.	We’ll see our husbands before they even have a chance to miss us.
Shall they see us?	Will they see us?
They shall, Nerissa, but in such a habit That they shall think we are accomplishèd With that we lack.	They will, Nerissa, but we’ll be disguised as men.
And twenty of these puny lies I’ll tell, That men shall swear I have discontinued school Above a twelvemonth.	I’ll tell twenty lies like that, so men will think I graduated from school at least a year ago.
I have within my mind A thousand raw tricks of these bragging jacks Which I will practice.	I know a thousand immature tricks like that, and I’ll use them all.
Why, shall we turn to men?	Why, are we turning to men?
Fie, what a question’s that If thou wert near a lewd interpreter!	What kind of question is that!
But come, I’ll tell thee all my whole device When I am in my coach, which stays for us At the park gate.	Here, I’ll tell you my whole plan in my carriage, which is waiting for us at the gate.
And therefore haste away, For we must measure twenty miles today.	So hurry up, because we have twenty miles to cover today.
Yes, truly, for look you, the sins of the father are to be laid upon the children.	Yes, look, it’s true that children are punished for the sins of their fathers.
Therefore I promise ye I fear you.	That’s why I’m worried about you.
I was always plain with you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter.	I’ve always been straightforward with you, so now I’m telling you what I think.
Therefore be o' good cheer, for truly I think you are damned.	Cheer up, because I think you’re going to hell.
There is but one hope in it that can do you any good, and that is but a kind of bastard hope neither.	There’s only one hope for you, and even that’s a kind of illegitimate hope.
And what hope is that, I pray thee?	What hope is that, may I ask?
Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you not, that you are not the Jew’s daughter.	You can hope your father isn’t your real father.
That were a kind of bastard hope indeed.	That really is an illegitimate hope.
So the sins of my mother should be visited upon me.	Then I’d be punished for the sins of my mother.
Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and mother.	In that case I’m afraid you’re damned by both your father and your mother.
Thus when I shun Scylla your father, I fall into Charybdis your mother.	When you avoid one trap, you fall into another.
Well, you are gone both ways.	You’re in trouble either way.
I shall be saved by my husband.	My husband will save me.
He hath made me a Christian.	He’s made me a Christian.
Truly, the more to blame he.	He was wrong to do that.
We were Christians eno' before, e'en as many as could well live one by another.	There were enough Christians before—as many of them as could stand to live near each other.
This making Christians will raise the price of hogs.	All these new Christians will make the price of hogs go up.
If we grow all to be pork-eaters, we shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money.	If we’re all pork-eaters, we won’t be able to get our hands on a slice of bacon, even if we’ve got the money for it.
I’ll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say.	I’ll tell my husband what you’ve said, Launcelot.
Here he comes.	Here he comes.
I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelot, if you thus get my wife into corners.	You’re going to make me jealous, Launcelot, if you keep taking my wife into dark corners like this!
Nay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo.	No, you don’t need to worry about us, Lorenzo.
Launcelot and I are out.	Launcelot and I can’t agree on anything.
He tells me flatly there is no mercy for me in heaven because I am a Jew’s daughter, and he says you are no good member of the commonwealth, for in converting Jews to Christians you raise the price of pork.	He says I won’t get into heaven because I’m a Jew’s daughter, and he says you’re irresponsible because by converting Jews to Christianity you’re raising the price of pork.
I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of the Negro’s belly.	I can justify that better than you can justify sleeping with Portia’s African servant.
It is much that the Moor should be more than reason.	The  It’s too bad there’s more of the Moor than there ought to be.
I think the best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence, and discourse grow commendable in none only but parrots.	I think the best sign of intelligence will soon be silence, and talking will only be a good thing for parrots to do.
That is done, sir.	That’s already been done, sir.
They have all stomachs.	They’re all ready to eat dinner.
Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you!	Good Lord, what a clown you are!
Wilt thou show the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant?	Are you planning on showing me all your wit at once?
For the table, sir, it shall be served in.	About the table, sir, dinner will be served on it.
For the meat, sir, it shall be covered.	As for the food, it will be served in covered dishes.
For your coming in to dinner, sir, why, let it be as humours and conceits shall govern.	As for your coming in to dinner, just do what you feel is right.
O dear discretion, how his words are suited!	Oh, he’s good at bending words around!
How cheerest thou, Jessica?	Anyway, how are you, Jessica?
How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio’s wife?	And how do you like Lord Bassanio’s wife?
Past all expressing.	I like her more than I can say.
And if on earth he do not merit it, In reason he should never come to heaven.	And if he doesn’t deserve this joy on earth, he’ll never deserve it in heaven.
Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match And on the wager lay two earthly women, And Portia one, there must be something else Pawned with the other, for the poor rude world Hath not her fellow.	The poor rude world doesn’t have her equal.
Even such a husband Hast thou of me as she is for a wife.	As good a wife as she is, that’s how good a husband I am to you.
First let us go to dinner.	First let’s go to dinner.
Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.	No, let me say some good things about you while I’m in the mood.
No, pray thee, let it serve for table talk.	No, please, save it for dinner conversation.
What, is Antonio here?	Is Antonio here?
Ready, so please your grace.	Yes, sir, I’m here.
I am sorry for thee.	I feel sorry for you.
Thou art come to answer A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch Uncapable of pity, void and empty From any dram of mercy.	You’ve come to face a ruthless enemy, an inhuman wretch incapable of pity, without any feelings of mercy.
I have heard Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify His rigorous course.	They tell me you’ve done everything you can to talk him out of what he’s doing.
But since he stands obdurate And that no lawful means can carry me Out of his envy’s reach, I do oppose My patience to his fury, and am armed To suffer with a quietness of spirit The very tyranny and rage of his.	I’m ready to suffer peacefully whatever he does to me in his cruelty and anger.
Go, one, and call the Jew into the court.	One of you go call the Jew into court here.
He is ready at the door.	He’s standing ready outside the door.
He comes, my lord.	Here he comes, my lord.
We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.	We all expect a nice answer from you, Jew.

Are you answered?	So, to answer your question.
This is no answer, thou unfeeling man, To excuse the current of thy cruelty.	It doesn’t excuse your cruel behavior.
I am not bound to please thee with my answers.	I don’t have to give you answers that you like.

You have among you many a purchased slave, Which—like your asses and your dogs and mules— You use in abject and in slavish parts Because you bought them.	Many of you own slaves, which—like your donkeys and dogs and mules—you use to perform awful jobs just because you bought them.

Why sweat they under burdens?	Why are you making them work so hard?
Let their beds Be made as soft as yours and let their palates Be seasoned with such viands”?	Let their beds be as soft as yours, and let them eat the same food as you”?

They would be better if well followed.	It would be better if you actually applied it to your life.
It is a good divine that follows his own instructions.	It takes a good priest to practice what he preaches.
But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband.	But thinking like this won’t help me choose a husband.
Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?	Isn’t it a pain that I can’t choose or refuse anyone, Nerissa?

Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew, Thou makest thy knife keen.	You’re sharpening that knife not on your sole but on your soul, you cruel Jew.
But no metal can— No, not the hangman’s axe—bear half the keenness Of thy sharp envy.	No metal—not even the executioner’s axe—could ever be half as sharp as your hatred.

Here will we sit and let the sounds of music Creep in our ears.	Let’s sit here and let the music fill our ears.
Soft stillness and the night Become the touches of sweet harmony.	Stillness and nighttime are perfect for beautiful music.
Sit, Jessica.	Sit down, Jessica.
Look how the floor of heaven Is thick inlaid with patens of bright gold.	Look at the stars, see how the floor of heaven is inlaid with small disks of bright gold.
Come ho, and wake Diana with a hymn!	Wake up the moon goddess with a hymn!
With sweetest touches pierce your mistress' ear, And draw her home with music.	Get her attention and draw her home with music.
I am never merry when I hear sweet music.	I’m never in the mood to laugh when I hear sweet music.
The motions of his spirit are dull as night, And his affections dark as Erebus.	His soul is as dull as night and dark as the underworld.
Let no such man be trusted.	Nobody like that should be trusted.
Mark the music.	Pay attention to the music.
That light we see is burning in my hall.	That light we see is coming from my hall.
How far that little candle throws his beams!	Look how far that little candle sends its light!
So shines a good deed in a naughty world.	That’s the way a good deed shines in a naughty world.
When the moon shone we did not see the candle.	While the moon was shining we didn’t even notice the candle.
So doth the greater glory dim the less.	Well, brighter lights always dim the smaller ones.
A substitute shines brightly as a king Until a king be by, and then his state Empties itself, as doth an inland brook Into the main of waters.	A governor shines as brightly as a king until a king is near by, and the governor suddenly looks like a nobody.
Music, hark.	Music, listen!
It is your music, madam, of the house.	It’s your music, madam, from your house.
Nothing is good, I see, without respect.	Now I see that you can’t call anything good except in right context.
How many things by season seasoned are To their right praise and true perfection!	How many things in life seem good to us because of when they happen!
Peace!	Quiet now!
How the moon sleeps with Endymion And would not be awaked.	Look how the moon seems to be sleeping with its lover and can’t be awoken!
That is the voice, Or I am much deceived, of Portia.	If I’m not mistaken, that’s Portia’s voice.
He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo— By the bad voice.	He recognizes me like a blind man recognizes a cuckoo—by its bad voice.
Dear lady, welcome home.	Dear lady, welcome home.
We have been praying for our husbands' welfare, Which speed, we hope, the better for our words.	We’ve been praying for our husbands' welfare.
Are they returned?	Have they come back?
Go in, Nerissa.	Go inside, Nerissa.
Give order to my servants that they take No note at all of our being absent hence.— Nor you, Lorenzo.—Jessica, nor you.	Tell my servants not to mention that we were gone.
I hear his trumpet.	I hear his trumpet.
This night methinks is but the daylight sick.	I think this night is just like sick daylight.
It looks a little paler.	It only looks a little paler.
Tis a day Such as the day is when the sun is hid.	It looks like a day when the sun is hidden.
I thank you, madam.	I’ll give  Thank you, darling.
Give welcome to my friend.	I’d like to introduce you to my friend.
This is the man, this is Antonio, To whom I am so infinitely bound.	This is Antonio, my dearest friend.
Sir, you are very welcome to our house.	Sir, welcome to our house.
It must appear in other ways than words, Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.	But action speaks louder than words, so I’ll cut short these polite words.
A quarrel, ho, already?	What, an argument already?
What’s the matter?	What’s the matter?
About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring That she did give me, whose posy was For all the world like cutler’s poetry Upon a knife, “Love me and leave me not.” What talk you of the posy or the value?	It said, “Love me and don’t leave me.” How can you talk about the quality of the poem or the value of the ring?
You swore to me when I did give it you That you would wear it till your hour of death, And that it should lie with you in your grave.	You swore to me when I gave it to you that you would wear it till you died, and that it would be buried with you.
Gave it a judge’s clerk!	And now you claim you gave it to a judge’s clerk!
He will, an if he live to be a man.	He will if he lives long enough to become a man.
Ay, if a woman live to be a man.	Yes, if a woman grows up to be a man.
I could not for my heart deny it him.	I didn’t have the heart to say no to him.
You were to blame, I must be plain with you, To part so slightly with your wife’s first gift, A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.	You were wrong to give away your wife’s first gift so thoughtlessly, a thing you swore to keep on your finger and bound faithfully to your body.
I gave my love a ring and made him swear Never to part with it.	I gave my lover a ring and made him swear never to lose it or give it away.
And here he stands.	And here he is.
I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it Nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth That the world masters.	I’d swear he wouldn’t leave it behind, or even take it off his finger, for all the money in the world.
Now in faith, Gratiano, You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief.	To tell the truth, Gratiano, you’re giving your wife a valid reason to get upset.
An ’twere to me, I should be mad at it.	If it were me, I’d be very upset too.
My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away Unto the judge that begged it and indeed Deserved it too.	Bassanio gave his ring to the judge who asked for it, and deserved it too.
And then the boy, his clerk, That took some pains in writing, he begged mine.	And then his clerk, who went to a lot of trouble with the writing, begged for mine.
And neither man nor master would take aught But the two rings.	Neither of them would take anything but the two rings.
What ring gave you my lord?	Which ring did you give away, my lord?
Not that, I hope, which you received of me.	Not the one I gave you, I hope.
If I could add a lie unto a fault I would deny it.	If I could make things better by lying, I’d deny it.
but you see my finger Hath not the ring upon it.	But you see my finger doesn’t have the ring on it.
It is gone.	It’s gone.
Sweet Portia, If you did know to whom I gave the ring, If you did know for whom I gave the ring, And would conceive for what I gave the ring, And how unwillingly I left the ring When naught would be accepted but the ring, You would abate the strength of your displeasure.	My dear Portia, if you knew who I gave the ring to, for whose sake I gave the ring to him, why I gave it to him, and how unwilling I was to leave it when he wouldn’t accept anything but the ring, you wouldn’t be so angry.
If you had known the virtue of the ring, Or half her worthiness that gave the ring, Or your own honor to contain the ring, You would not then have parted with the ring.	If you’d known how much that ring meant, how much the woman who gave it to you is worth, or how much your honor depended on your keeping the ring, you wouldn’t have let it go.
Nerissa teaches me what to believe.	Nerissa’s got the right idea.
I’ll die for ’t but some woman had the ring.	I’ll bet my life you gave some woman the ring!
What should I say, sweet lady?	What could I say, my dear?
I was enforced to send it after him.	I had to send it to him.
Let not that doctor e'er come near my house!	Don’t let that lawyer ever come near my house!
Since he hath got the jewel that I loved, And that which you did swear to keep for me, I will become as liberal as you.	Since he has the jewel I loved, which you swore you’d keep forever, I’ll be as generous as you were to him.
I’ll not deny him anything I have, No, not my body, nor my husband’s bed.	I won’t deny him anything of mine, including my own body and my husband’s bed.
Know him I shall, I am well sure of it.	I’ll recognize him all right, I’m sure of it.
Lie not a night from home.	So don’t spend one night away from this house.
Watch me like Argus.	Watch me like a hawk.
If you do not, if I be left alone, Now, by mine honor—which is yet mine own— I’ll have that doctor for my bedfellow.	If you don’t, if I’m left alone, I swear I’ll have that legal expert as my bedfellow.
I am th' unhappy subject of these quarrels.	All these quarrels are about me.
Sir, grieve not you.	Don’t be upset.
Portia, forgive me this enforcèd wrong, And in the hearing of these many friends I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes Wherein I see myself—     Mark you but that!	All these friends are my witnesses, so I swear to you, I swear by your beautiful eyes, in which I see myself reflected— Did you hear that!
In both my eyes he doubly sees himself— In each eye, one.	He sees himself in my two eyes, so there’s two of him.
Swear by your double self, And there’s an oath of credit!	He should swear by his two-faced self, and that’s an oath I’ll believe!
Nay, but hear me.	No, just listen to me.
Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear I never more will break an oath with thee.	If you forgive my mistake, I swear I’ll never break an oath with you again.
I once did lend my body for his wealth, Which but for him that had your husband’s ring Had quite miscarried.	I lent my body once to make him rich.
By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!	My God, it’s the same one I gave the judge!
I had it of him.	I got it from him.
What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it?	What, did you cheat on us before we deserved it?
Speak not so grossly.—You are all amazed.	Don’t be crass.—You all look confused.
I am dumb.	I’m speechless.
Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it Unless he live until he be a man.	Yes, but the clerk will never do it, unless he grows up to be a man.
Sweet lady, you have given me life and living.	Madam, you’ve given me life and given me a living too.
How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony’s nephew?	How did you like the young German, the duke of Saxony’s nephew?
Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober, and most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk.	He’s pretty awful in the morning when he’s sobering up, and even worse in the afternoon when he’s drunk.
When he is best he is a little worse than a man, and when he is worst he is little better than a beast.	At his best he’s a little less than a man, and at his worst he’s little more than an animal.
I will do any thing, Nerissa, ere I’ll be married to a sponge.	I’ll do anything rather than marry a drunk, Nerissa.
You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords.	You don’t have to worry about any of these lords, my lady.
And I pray God grant them a fair departure.	I wish them all safe trips home.
Do you not remember, lady, in your father’s time a Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither in company of the Marquess of Montferrat?	Do you remember a Venetian scholar and soldier who accompanied the marquess of Montferrat here once when your father was still alive?
How now, Lorenzo?	How are you, Lorenzo?
My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.	My clerk has some comforting news for you, too.
Ay, and I’ll give them him without a fee.	Yes, and I’ll give it to him for free.
Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way Of starvèd people.	Ladies, you’re dropping bread from the heavens to starving people.
It is almost morning, And yet I am sure you are not satisfied Of these events at full.	It’s almost morning, but I’m sure you’re not fully satisfied about what happened.
Let us go in, And charge us there upon interr'gatories, And we will answer all things faithfully.	Let’s go inside and we’ll answer all your questions truthfully.
Let it be so.	All right, then.
The first interr'gatory That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is Whether till the next night she had rather stay, Or go to bed now, being two hours to day.	My first question for Nerissa is whether she’d rather wait till tomorrow night or go to bed now, since there are only two more hours till morning.
But were the day come, I should wish it dark, That I were couching with the doctor’s clerk.	When the day comes, I’ll wish it were nighttime, so I could sleep with the legal expert’s clerk.
True, madam.	Yes, madam, that’s the one.
He, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.	He deserves a beautiful wife more than all the other men I’ve ever seen.
I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy praise.	I remember him well, and my memory tells me that he deserves your praise.
How now, what news?	Hello, do you have any news?
The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take their leave.	The four suitors are looking for you so they can say goodbye, madam.
And there is a forerunner come from a fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the prince his master will be here tonight.	And there’s a messenger representing a fifth one, the prince of Morocco, who says the prince will be here tonight.
If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should be glad of his approach.	If I could say hello to the fifth one as happily as I’ll say goodbye to the first four, I’d be very happy he’s coming.
If he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had rather he should shrive me than wive me.	If he’s as good as a saint but is black like a devil, I’d rather he hear my confession than marry me.
Come, Nerissa.—	Let’s go, Nerissa.—
Three thousand ducats, well.	Three thousand ducats, hmmm.
Ay, sir, for three months.	Yes, for three months.
For three months, well.	For three months, hmmm.
For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.	As I said before, Antonio will guarantee the loan.
Antonio shall become bound, well.	If I default, he’ll pay you.
May you stead me?	Antonio will guarantee it, hmmm.
Will you pleasure me?	Can you help me?
Shall I know your answer?	What’s your answer?
Three thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio bound.	Three thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio will guarantee it.
Your answer to that?	Your answer?
Antonio is a good man.	Antonio’s a good man.
Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?	Have you heard anything to the contrary?
Yet his means are in supposition.	But his investments are uncertain right now.
He hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the Indies.	He has one ship bound for Tripoli, another heading for the Indies.
I understand moreover, upon the Rialto, he hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and other ventures he hath squandered abroad.	What’s more, people at the
But ships are but boards, sailors but men.	But ships are just fragile boards, and sailors are just men.
There be land rats and water rats, water thieves and land thieves—I mean pirates—and then there is the peril of waters, winds, and rocks.	There are rats and thieves and pirates—not to mention storms, winds, and rocks.
The man is notwithstanding sufficient.	But in spite of all this, the man is still wealthy enough.
Be assured you may.	I assure you he can.
This is Signor Antonio.	Oh yes—to smell  This is Signor Antonio.
In sooth, I know not why I am so sad.	To be honest, I don’t know why I’m so sad.
It wearies me; you say it wearies you.	I’m tired of it, and you say you’re tired of it too.
Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth, The better part of my affections would Be with my hopes abroad.	I’d be peering over maps to figure out the best ports, piers, and waterways.
And every object that might make me fear Misfortune to my ventures out of doubt Would make me sad.	Everything that made me worry about my ships would make me sad.
Shylock, do you hear?	Shylock, are you listening?
I am debating of my present store, And by the near guess of my memory I cannot instantly raise up the gross Of full three thousand ducats.	If I remember correctly, I can’t raise the entire three thousand ducats immediately.
What of that?	But so what?
Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe, Will furnish me.	Tubal, a wealthy Jew I know, will supply me with the cash.
But soft!	But wait a minute!
How many months Do you desire?	How many months do you want?
Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow By taking nor by giving of excess, Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend, I’ll break a custom.	Shylock, although I never lend or borrow with interest, I’m willing to break that habit to help a friend in need.
Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.	Oh yes, three thousand ducats.
And for three months.	For three months.
I had forgot—three months.	Yes, I forgot—three months.
You told me so.	That’s right.
I do never use it.	That’s not how I do business.
When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban’s sheep— This Jacob from our holy Abram was, As his wise mother wrought in his behalf, The third possessor, ay, he was the third— And what of him?	When Jacob took care of his uncle Laban’s sheep—Jacob was the heir to his grandfather Abraham’s birthright, because his mother cleverly arranged for her husband Isaac to make Jacob his heir— What’s your point?
Did he take interest?	Did he charge interest?
This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served for— A thing not in his power to bring to pass But swayed and fashioned by the hand of heaven.	Jacob didn’t have any control over what happened.
Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?	That your interest payments are like Jacob’s sheep?
But note me, signor—	But listen to me, signor—
An evil soul producing holy witness Is like a villain with a smiling cheek, A goodly apple rotten at the heart.	An evil soul using a holy story is like a criminal who smiles at you.
Oh, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!	Oh, liars can look so honest!
Three months from twelve, then.	Three months from twelve months of the year.
Let me see.	Let me see.
The rate— Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?	The interest rate will be— Well, Shylock?
Signor Antonio, many a time and oft In the Rialto you have rated me About my moneys and my usances.	Signor Antonio, you’ve often insulted my money and my business practices in the Rialto.
You call me misbeliever, cutthroat dog, And spet upon my Jewish gaberdine— And all for use of that which is mine own.	And all because I use my own money to make a profit.
Well then, it now appears you need my help.	And now it looks like you need my help.
Go to, then!	All right then.
You come to me and you say, “Shylock, we would have moneys.” You say so!— You, that did void your rheum upon my beard And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur Over your threshold!	You come to me saying, “Shylock, we need money.” You say that!—even though you spat on my beard and kicked me like you’d kick a stray mutt out your front door.
Moneys is your suit.	And now you’re asking for money.
What should I say to you?	What can I tell you?
Should I not say, “Hath a dog money?	Shouldn’t I say, “Does a dog have money?
Is it possible A cur can lend three thousand ducats?” Or Shall I bend low and in a bondman’s key With bated breath and whispering humbleness Say this:	Is it possible for a mutt to lend three thousand ducats?” Or should I bend down low, and in a humble and submissive voice say:
If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not As to thy friends, for when did friendship take A breed for barren metal of his friend?	If you’re going to lend us this money, don’t lend it to us as if we were your friends.
But lend it rather to thine enemy, Who, if he break, thou mayst with better face Exact the penalty.	Instead, lend it to me as your enemy.
Why, look you how you storm!	Look at you getting all riled up!
I would be friends with you and have your love, Forget the shames that you have stained me with, Supply your present wants and take no doit Of usance for my moneys—and you’ll not hear me!	I want to be friends with you, and forget all the times you’ve embarrassed and humiliated me.
This is kind I offer.	I’m making a kind offer—zero percent financing.
This were kindness.	That really would be kind.
This kindness will I show.	I’ll show you how kind I am.
Go with me to a notary, seal me there Your single bond, and—in a merry sport— If you repay me not on such a day, In such a place, such sum or sums as are Expressed in the condition, let the forfeit Be nominated for an equal pound Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken In what part of your body pleaseth me.	If you don’t repay me on the day we agree on, in the place we name, for the sum of money fixed in our contract, your penalty will be a pound of your pretty flesh, to be cut off and taken out of whatever part of your body I like.
Content, in faith.	It’s a deal.
I’ll seal to such a bond, And say there is much kindness in the Jew.	I’ll agree to those terms and even say that Jews are nice.
You shall not seal to such a bond for me!	No, you can’t sign a contract like that for me!
I’ll rather dwell in my necessity.	I’d rather go without the money.
Within these two months—that’s a month before This bond expires—I do expect return Of thrice three times the value of this bond.	In two months—a month before this loan is due—I expect to earn more than three times that much from my investments.
A pound of man’s flesh taken from a man Is not so estimable, profitable neither, As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats.	A pound of human flesh taken isn’t even as valuable as a pound of mutton or beef.
If he will take it, so.	If he agrees, great.
If not, adieu.	If not, goodbye.
And for my love I pray you wrong me not.	And I hope you won’t think badly of me.
Yes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.	Yes, Shylock, I’ll sign the contract and agree to its terms.
Then meet me forthwith at the notary’s.	Then meet me right away at the notary’s.
Give him direction for this merry bond, And I will go and purse the ducats straight, See to my house left in the fearful guard Of an unthrifty knave, and presently I will be with you.	Give him the instructions for our amusing little contract, and I’ll go get the money for you right away.
Hie thee, gentle Jew.	Hurry up, my Jewish friend.
My ships come home a month before the day.	My ships will come home a month before the money is due.
I would not change this hue Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.	I wouldn’t change it except to make you think of me, my darling queen.
Even for that I thank you.	Thank you for saying that.
Therefore I pray you lead me to the caskets To try my fortune.	Show me the caskets and let me try my luck.
By this scimitar That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince That won three fields of Sultan Solyman, I would o'erstare the sternest eyes that look, Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth, Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear, Yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey, To win the lady.	I swear by my sword, which killed the Shah of Persia and a Persian prince and defeated the Sultan Suleiman three times, that I would face the meanest-looking warriors on earth.
But, alas the while!	But this is bad!
Nor will not.	Think about it carefully.
Come, bring me unto my chance.	Let me take my chances.
First, forward to the temple.	Let’s go to the temple first.
After dinner Your hazard shall be made.	You can take your chances after dinner.
Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this Jew, my master.	I’m sure I’ll feel guilty if I run away from this Jew, my master.
For the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,” says the fiend, “and run.” Well, my conscience, hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely to me, “My honest friend Launcelot, being an honest man’s son”—or rather an honest woman’s son, for indeed my father did something smack, something grow to.	Be tough,” says the devil, “and run!” But then my conscience, hanging around my heart, says very wisely to me, “My good friend Launcelot, you’re a good boy, the son of an honest man,” really, that should be the son of an honest woman, since my father cheated on my mother.
He had a kind of taste.—Well, my conscience says, “Launcelot, budge not.” “Budge!” says the fiend.	Anyway, my conscience says, “Stay put.” “Go,” the devil says.
Budge not,” says my conscience.	Don’t go,” says my conscience.
Conscience,” say I, “you counsel well.” “Fiend,” say I, “you counsel well.” To be ruled by my conscience I should stay with the Jew my master, who, God bless the mark, is a kind of devil.	Conscience,” I say, “you give good advice.” “Devil,” I say, “you give good advice.” If I listened to my conscience, I’d stay with the Jew my master, who’s a devil.
And to run away from the Jew I should be ruled by the fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the devil himself.	But if I ran away from the Jew, I’d be following the advice of the devil, who’s the very devil himself.
The fiend gives the more friendly counsel.	The devil’s advice is nicer.
I will run, fiend.	I’ll run, devil.
I will run.	Tell me to run, and I’ll run.
Master young man, you, I pray you, which is the way to Master Jew’s?	Excuse me, young man, how do I get to the Jew’s residence?
Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way to Master Jew’s?	Young man, excuse me, how do I get to the Jew’s?
Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but at the next turning of all on your left.	Turn right at the next turn, but at the following turn, turn left.
Marry, at the very next turning turn of no hand, but turn down indirectly to the Jew’s house.	Oh, and then at the very next turn, don’t turn left or right, but turn down and around to the Jew’s house.
By God’s sonties, ’twill be a hard way to hit.	Good heavens, those are difficult directions.
Can you tell me whether one Launcelot that dwells with him, dwell with him or no?	Can you tell me if a man named Launcelot, who lives with him, is still there?
Talk you of young Master Launcelot?	Are you talking about young Master Launcelot?
No “master,” sir, but a poor man’s son.	He’s not a “master,” sir, he’s just a poor man’s son.
His father, though I say ’t, is an honest exceeding poor man and, God be thanked, well to live.	His father, if I do say so myself, is an honest but very poor man, and, thank God, likely to live a long time.
Your worship’s friend and Launcelot, sir.	He’s just Launcelot.
Shall I have the thought To think on this, and shall I lack the thought That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?	Who wouldn’t get sad thinking about things like that?
But tell not me.	It’s obvious.
Believe me, no.	No, that’s not it, trust me.
Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.	So it’s not my business that’s making me sad.
Why then, you are in love.	Well then, you must be in love.
Not in love neither?	You’re not in love either?
But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you, talk you of young Master Launcelot?	But excuse me,  Yes, I’m talking about Launcelot, sir.
Ergo, Master Launcelot.	Oh, no.
Marry, God forbid!	God forbid!
The boy was the very staff of my age, my very prop.	The boy was going to support me in my old age!
Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff or a prop?	What am I, a cane?
Do you know me, Father?	Don’t you recognize me, father?
Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman.	Heaven help me, I don’t know you, sir.
But I pray you, tell me, is my boy, God rest his soul, alive or dead?	But please tell me, is my boy—God rest his soul—alive or dead?
Do you not know me, Father?	You really don’t recognize me, father?
Alack, sir, I am sand-blind.	Sir, I’m half-blind.
I know you not.	I don’t know you.
Nay, indeed if you had your eyes, you might fail of the knowing me.	Even if you had your eyes, you still might not recognize me.
It is a wise father that knows his own child.	It takes a wise father to know his own child.
Well, old man, I will tell you news of your son.	Well, old man, I’ll tell you news of your son.
Give me your blessing.	Give me your blessing.
Pray you, sir, stand up.	Please stand up!
I am sure you are not Launcelot, my boy.	I’m sure you aren’t Launcelot, my boy.
Pray you, let’s have no more fooling about it, but give me your blessing.	Give me your blessing.
I am Launcelot, your boy that was, your son that is, your child that shall be.	I’m Launcelot, who was your boy, is your son, and will be your child.
I cannot think you are my son.	I can’t believe you’re my son.
Her name is Margery, indeed.	Yes, you’re right, her name is Margery.
I’ll be sworn, if thou be Launcelot, thou art mine own flesh and blood.	If you’re Launcelot, then you’re my own flesh and blood.
It should seem then that Dobbin’s tail grows backward.	Then Dobbin’s tail must be growing backward.
I am sure he had more hair of his tail than I have of my face when I last saw him.	I’m sure he had more hair on his tail than I have on my face when I last saw him.
Lord, how art thou changed!	Lord, how you’ve changed!
How dost thou and thy master agree?	How are you and your master getting along?
I have brought him a present.	I’ve brought him a present.
How 'gree you now?	How are you?
My master’s a very Jew.	My master’s a total Jew.
Give him a present.	You’re giving him a present?
Give him a halter.	Give him a noose to hang himself.
I am famished in his service.	He’s starving me to death.
You may tell every finger I have with my ribs.	You can see my ribs so well you can count them.
Father, I am glad you are come.	I’m glad you’ve come, father.
Give me your present to one Master Bassanio, who indeed gives rare new liveries.	Give me your present to give to Master Bassanio.
Gramercy!	Thank you.
Wouldst thou aught with me?	What do you want with me?
What would you?	What do you want?
Serve you, sir.	To work for you, sir.
That is the very defect of the matter, sir.	That’s what we’re trying to say, sir.
I know thee well.	I know who you are.
Thou hast obtained thy suit.	You can have what you want.
Father, in.	Father, go ahead.
My best endeavours shall be done herein.	BASSANIO Please, Leonardo, think about this  I’ll do my best.
Yonder, sir, he walks.	He’s walking over there, sir.
Signor Bassanio!	Signor Bassanio!
Gratiano!	Gratiano!
I have a suit to you.	I have a favor to ask.
You have obtained it.	Anything.
You must not deny me.	Don’t say no.
I must go with you to Belmont.	Let me go with you to Belmont.
Why, then you must.	Well, if you have to go, you have to go.
But hear thee, Gratiano.	But listen to me, Gratiano.
Thou art too wild, too rude and bold of voice— Parts that become thee happily enough And in such eyes as ours appear not faults.	Sometimes you get a bit too wild, and you let your voice get a bit loud and rude.
Pray thee, take pain To allay with some cold drops of modesty Thy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behavior I be misconst’red in the place I go to, And lose my hopes.	Please, try to act a little more serious, or the people in Belmont will get the wrong impression about me, and your wildness will make me blow my chance with Portia.
Signor Bassanio, hear me.	Listen, Signor Bassanio, there’s nothing to worry about.
If I do not put on a sober habit, Talk with respect and swear but now and then, Wear prayer books in my pocket, look demurely— Nay more.	I’ll carry prayer books in my pocket and look sweet—even more.
While grace is saying, hood mine eyes Thus with my hat, and sigh and say, “Amen”— Use all the observance of civility Like one well studied in a sad ostent To please his grandam, never trust me more.	If I don’t do all this, never trust me again.
Well, we shall see your bearing.	Well, we’ll see how you act.
Nay, but I bar tonight.	Okay, but tonight doesn’t count.
You shall not gauge me By what we do tonight.	You can’t judge me based on what I do tonight.
I would entreat you rather to put on Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends That purpose merriment.	I’d rather see you having fun, because we have friends coming who want to have fun.
But fare you well.	Anyway, I have to say goodbye to you now.
I have some business.	I’ve got some business to take care of.
I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so.	I’m sorry you’re leaving my father like this.
Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil, Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness.	It’s hell in our house, and you helped cheer it up, like a funny devil.
And Launcelot, soon at supper shalt thou see Lorenzo, who is thy new master’s guest.	You’ll soon be meeting Lorenzo at supper; he’ll be a guest of your new master.
Give him this letter.	Give him this letter.
Adieu!	Goodbye.
If a Christian do not play the knave and get thee, I am much deceived.	I’m sure some Christian will resort to trickery to get you.
But adieu.	But goodbye.
These foolish drops do something drown my manly spirit.	It’s not manly to cry.
Adieu.	Goodbye.
Farewell, good Launcelot.	Goodbye, Launcelot.
Alack, what heinous sin is it in me To be ashamed to be my father’s child!	Oh God, what a heinous sinner I am, being ashamed to be my father’s child!
But though I am a daughter to his blood, I am not to his manners.	But I need to remember I’m related to him by blood, not behavior.
O Lorenzo, If thou keep promise, I shall end this strife, Become a Christian and thy loving wife.	Oh Lorenzo, if you keep your promise to me, I’ll end this agony by becoming a Christian and marrying you.
Nay, we will slink away in supper time, Disguise us at my lodging, and return, All in an hour.	No, we’ll sneak away at supper time, disguise ourselves with masks at my house, and come back in an hour.
We have not made good preparation.	But we haven’t made any preparations.
We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers.	We haven’t even talked about who’ll be our torchbearers.
Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly ordered, And better in my mind not undertook.	I think it’s better to call it off.
Tis now but four o'clock.	It’s only four o'clock now.
We have two hours To furnish us.	We have two hours to get ready.
Friend Launcelot, what’s the news?	Launcelot, what’s going on?
I know the hand.	I recognize the handwriting.
Love news, in faith?	I bet it’s a love letter!
Whither goest thou?	Where are you going?
Marry, sir, to bid my old master the Jew to sup tonight with my new master the Christian.	To invite my former boss, the Jew, to dine tonight with my new master, the Christian.
And so will I.	Me too.
Meet me and Gratiano At Gratiano’s lodging some hour hence.	Meet me and Gratiano at his house in about an hour.
Tis good we do so.	It’s good we’re doing this.
Was not that letter from fair Jessica?	Wasn’t that letter from Jessica?
Some that will evermore peep through their eyes And laugh like parrots at a bagpiper, And other of such vinegar aspect That they’ll not show their teeth in way of smile Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.	Some people will laugh at anything, and others are so grouchy they won’t even crack a smile when they hear something hysterically funny.
Fare ye well.	Goodbye, then.
Your worth is very dear in my regard.	You’re both very precious to me.
I take it your own business calls on you And you embrace th' occasion to depart.	You need to leave to take care of your own business.
Good signors both, when shall we laugh?	We’re available.
My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio, We two will leave you.	Bassanio, we’ll say goodbye for now, since you’ve found Antonio.
I will not fail you.	Don’t worry, I’ll be there.
I must needs tell thee all.	I have to tell you everything.
Who bids thee call?	Who asked you to call her?
I do not bid thee call.	I’m not asking you to call her.
Your worship was wont to tell me that I could do nothing without bidding.	You always loved to tell me I couldn’t do anything without being told.
Call you?	Did you call me?
What is your will?	Do you need something?
I am bid forth to supper, Jessica.	I’ve been invited to supper, Jessica.
There are my keys.—But wherefore should I go?	Here are my keys.—But why should I go?
I am not bid for love.	I wasn’t invited because they like me.
They flatter me.	They’re just flattering me.
But yet I’ll go in hate to feed upon The prodigal Christian.—Jessica, my girl, Look to my house.	But I’ll go out of spite, to feed off the wasteful Christian.—Jessica, my girl, watch the house.
I am right loath to go.	I don’t feel like going.
There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest, For I did dream of money bags tonight.	I know because I dreamed of money bags last night.
I beseech you, sir, go.	Please go, sir.
My young master doth expect your reproach.	My new master is expecting your approach.
So do I his.	And I’m expecting his reproach.
And they have conspired together.	And they’ve been plotting things together.
I will not say you shall see a masque, but if you do then it was not for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on Black Monday last at six o'clock i' th' morning falling out that year on Ash Wednesday was four year in th' afternoon.	I knew there would be a masquerade when I got that bad omen of a bloody nose last Easter Monday, at six in the morning, four years after I got the same kind of bloody nose on Ash Wednesday, in the afternoon.
What, are there masques?	What, there’s going to be a masquerade?
But stop my house’s ears—I mean my casements— Let not the sound of shallow foppery enter My sober house.	Don’t stick your head out into the public street to stare at the Christian fools with painted faces.
By Jacob’s staff, I swear, I have no mind of feasting forth tonight.	Block up my house’s ears—I mean the windows.
I will go before, sir.— Mistress, look out at window, for all this.	I’ll go ahead of you, sir.
What says that fool of Hagar’s offspring, ha?	What did that gentile fool say to you, hmmm?
His words were, “Farewell, mistress.” Nothing else.	He said “Goodbye, madam,” and nothing else.
The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder, Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day More than the wildcat.	The fool’s nice enough, but he’s such a huge eater, and slow as a snail when he works.
Drones hive not with me.	He sleeps all day like a cat.
Well, Jessica, go in.	Anyway, Jessica, go inside.
Perhaps I will return immediately.	I might come back soon.
Do as I bid you.	Do as I told you.
Shut doors after you.	Shut the doors after you.
Fast bind, fast find.	Goodbye.
Farewell, and if my fortune be not crost, I have a father, you a daughter, lost.	If luck’s with me, I’ll lose a father, and you’ll lose a daughter.
This is the penthouse under which Lorenzo Desired us to make stand.	This is the roof under which Lorenzo said to meet him.
His hour is almost past.	He’s late.
And it is marvel he outdwells his hour, For lovers ever run before the clock.	Yes, and that’s surprising, because lovers are usually early.
Oh, ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly To seal love’s bonds new made than they are wont To keep obligèd faith unforfeited.	Yes, for new lovers time passes ten times faster than for couples who’ve been married forever.
That ever holds.	That’s always true.
Who riseth from a feast With that keen appetite that he sits down?	Who gets up from a meal with the same appetite he had when he sat down?
Where is the horse that doth untread again His tedious measures with the unbated fire That he did pace them first?	Can any horse retrace his footsteps with the same energy he had when he walked them the first time?
All things that are, Are with more spirit chasèd than enjoyed.	We chase everything in life more excitedly than we actually enjoy it when we get it.
Here comes Lorenzo.	Here comes Lorenzo.
More of this hereafter.	We’ll talk about this later.
Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode.	My dear friends, thanks for your patience.
Not I but my affairs have made you wait.	I had business that made me late.
When you shall please to play the thieves for wives, I’ll watch as long for you then.	When you have to steal your own wives some day, I’ll wait for you just as long.
Approach.	Come over here.
Who’s within?	Who’s in there?
Who are you?	Who are you?
Tell me for more certainty, Albeit I’ll swear that I do know your tongue.	Tell me so I can be sure, though I swear I recognize your voice.
Lorenzo, and thy love.	I’m Lorenzo, your love.
Lorenzo certain, and my love indeed— For who love I so much?	Lorenzo, that’s for sure, and I’m also sure you’re my love—who else do I love so much?
And now who knows But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?	And now who but you knows whether I’m yours?
Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.	As God is my witness, you know you’re mine.
Here, catch this casket.	Here, catch this box.
It is worth the pains.	It’ll be worth your while.
Descend, for you must be my torchbearer.	You have to be my torchbearer for the masquerade.
What, must I hold a candle to my shames?	What, I have to hold a candle up so people can see what I’m doing?
I will make fast the doors and gild myself With some more ducats, and be with you straight.	I’ll lock up the doors, grab some more ducats, and be with you right away.
Now, by my hood, a gentle and no Jew.	My God, she can’t be a Jew, she’s too nice!
Beshrew me but I love her heartily.	God, I’m crazy about her.
For she is wise, if I can judge of her.	She’s wise, if I’m judging her right.
And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true.	She’s beautiful, if my eyes can see.
And true she is, as she hath proved herself.	And she’s loyal, as she has proven.
And therefore, like herself—wise, fair and true— Shall she be placèd in my constant soul.	And as long as she’s herself—wise, beautiful, and faithful—she’ll always have a place in my heart.
What, art thou come?—On, gentlemen, away!	Ah, you’re here?—Come on, gentlemen, let’s go!
Our masquing mates by this time for us stay.	Our masquerade mates are waiting for us.
Who’s there?	Who’s there?
Signor Antonio?	Signor Antonio?
Tis nine o'clock.	It’s nine o'clock!
Our friends all stay for you.	Our friends are all waiting for you.
No masque tonight.	There’s no masquerade tonight.
I have sent twenty out to seek for you.	I’ve sent twenty people to look for you.
I am glad on ’t.	I’m glad.
I desire no more delight Than to be under sail and gone tonight.	I want to head out tonight.
The one of them contains my picture, Prince.	One of them contains my picture.
If you choose that, then I am yours withal.	If you choose that one, I’m yours, along with the picture.
Some god direct my judgment!	I wish some god could help me choose!
Let me see.	Let me see.
I will survey th' inscriptions back again.	I’ll look over the inscriptions again.
What says this leaden casket?	What does the lead box say?
Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.” Must give—for what?	He who chooses me must give and risk all he has.” Must give everything—for what?
For lead?	For lead?
Hazard for lead?	Risk everything for lead?
This casket threatens.	This box is too threatening.
Men that hazard all Do it in hope of fair advantages.	Men who risk everything hope to make profits.
A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross.	A golden mind doesn’t bend down to choose something worthless.
I’ll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.	So I won’t give or risk anything for lead.
What says the silver with her virgin hue?	What does the silver one say?
Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.” “As much as he deserves!”—pause there, Morocco, And weigh thy value with an even hand.	He who chooses me will get as much as he deserves.” As much as he deserves—wait a minute there, Morocco, and consider your own value with a level head.
What if I strayed no further, but chose here?	What if I went no further and chose this one?
Let’s see once more this saying graved in gold, “Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.” Why, that’s the lady.	But let’s see once more what the gold one says: “He who chooses me will get what many men want.” That’s Portia!
All the world desires her.	The whole world wants her.
From the four corners of the earth they come To kiss this shrine, this mortal breathing saint.	They come from the four corners of the earth to kiss this shrine and see this living, breathing saint.
The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds Of wide Arabia are as thoroughfares now For princes to come view fair Portia.	Princes travel across deserts and the vast wilderness of Arabia to come see the beautiful Portia.
The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar To stop the foreign spirits, but they come As o'er a brook to see fair Portia.	The wide ocean doesn’t prevent them from coming to see her—they travel across it as if it were a little stream.
One of these three contains her heavenly picture.	One of these three boxes contains her lovely picture.
Is ’t like that lead contains her?	Could the lead one contain it?
Twere damnation To think so base a thought.	No, it’d be a sin to think such a low thought.
It were too gross To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.	Lead’s too crass to hold her.
Or shall I think in silver she’s immured, Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?	Is she enclosed in silver, which is ten times less valuable than gold?
O sinful thought!	Oh, what a sinful thought!
Never so rich a gem Was set in worse than gold.	Nobody ever set a gem like her in a worse setting than gold.
They have in England A coin that bears the figure of an angel Stamped in gold, but that’s insculped upon.	They have a coin in England stamped with the figure of an angel, but that’s just engraved on the surface.
You look not well, Signor Antonio.	You don’t look well, Antonio.
You have too much respect upon the world.	People with too much invested in the world always get hurt.
And let my liver rather heat with wine Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.	I’d rather overload my liver with wine than starve my heart by denying myself fun.
I’ll tell thee more of this another time.	I’ll talk to you more about this some other time.
But fish not with this melancholy bait For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.— Come, good Lorenzo.—Fare ye well awhile.	I’m a fool.—Let’s go, Lorenzo.—Goodbye for now.
I’ll end my exhortation after dinner.	I’ll finish my lecture after dinner.
Lies all within.—Deliver me the key.	Here an angel’s lying in a golden bed.—Give me the key.
Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may!	I will choose this one and try my chances.
There, take it, Prince.	Damn it!
O hell, what have we here?	What’s this?
A carrion death, within whose empty eye There is a written scroll.	It’s a skull with a scroll in its empty eye socket.
I’ll read the writing.	I’ll read it aloud.
All that glisters is not gold— Often have you heard that told.	All that glitters is not gold— You’ve often heard that said.
Many a man his life hath sold But my outside to behold.	Many men have sold their souls Just to view my shiny surface.
Gilded tombs do worms enfold.	But gilded tombs contain worms.
Had you been as wise as bold, Young in limbs, in judgment old, Your answer had not been inscrolled.	If you’d been as wise as you were bold, With an old man’s mature judgment, You wouldn’t have had to read this scroll.
Portia, adieu.	Portia, goodbye to you.
I have too grieved a heart To take a tedious leave.	My heart’s too sad for long goodbyes.
Thus losers part.	Losers always leave quickly.
A gentle riddance.—Draw the curtains, go.— Let all of his complexion choose me so.	Good riddance!—Close the curtains and leave.—I hope everyone who looks like him will make the same choice.
Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail.	I saw Bassanio sail away, and Gratiano went with him.
With him is Gratiano gone along.	I’m sure Lorenzo isn’t on their ship.
And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.	That wicked Jew got the duke to listen to his complaints.
The villain Jew with outcries raised the Duke, Who went with him to search Bassanio’s ship.	The duke went with him to search Bassanio’s ship.
He came too late.	He got there too late.
The ship was under sail.	The ship was already sailing.
But there the Duke was given to understand That in a gondola were seen together Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica.	But once he got there, the duke learned that Lorenzo and his lover Jessica were together in a gondola.
Besides, Antonio certified the Duke They were not with Bassanio in his ship.	In any case, Antonio assured the duke they weren’t with Bassanio on his ship.
I never heard a passion so confused, So strange, outrageous, and so variable, As the dog Jew did utter in the streets.	I’ve never heard such confused emotions as what that Jew dog was shouting in the streets.
O my daughter, Fled with a Christian!	Ran off with a Christian!
O my Christian ducats!	Oh my Christian ducats!
Justice, find the girl!	Justice, find the girl!
She hath the stones upon her, and the ducats.” Why, all the boys in Venice follow him, Crying, “His stones, his daughter, and his ducats!”	She has the stones on her, and the ducats.” I know, all the boys in Venice are following him, yelling, “His stones, his daughter, and his ducats!”
Let good Antonio look he keep his day, Or he shall pay for this.	I hope Antonio repays his loan on time, or he’ll suffer for this.
Marry, well remembered.	That’s a good point.
I reasoned with a Frenchman yesterday, Who told me, in the narrow seas that part The French and English, there miscarried A vessel of our country richly fraught.	I spoke with a Frenchman yesterday who said that a Venetian ship loaded with treasure was wrecked in the English Channel.
You were best to tell Antonio what you hear— Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.	You should tell Antonio what you hear—but don’t do it suddenly, because it might upset him.
I saw Bassanio and Antonio part.	I saw Bassanio and Antonio say goodbye.
Bassanio told him he would make some speed Of his return.	Bassanio told him he’d try to hurry back.
And for the Jew’s bond which he hath of me, Let it not enter in your mind of love.	As for the Jew’s contract, don’t let it be a factor in your plans.
And so they parted.	Then he shook Bassanio’s hand affectionately—and they separated.
I think he only loves the world for him.	I think he only loves life because of Bassanio.
I pray thee, let us go and find him out And quicken his embracèd heaviness With some delight or other.	Let’s go find him and cheer him up.
Do we so.	Yes, let’s do that.
Draw the curtain straight.	Hurry, hurry, close the curtain quick.
The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath And comes to his election presently.	The prince of Arragon has taken his oath, and he’s coming to make his choice now.
Behold, there stand the caskets, noble Prince.	Look, here are the boxes, prince.
If you choose that wherein I am contained, Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized.	If you choose the one that contains my picture, we’ll be married right away.
But if you fail, without more speech, my lord, You must be gone from hence immediately.	But if you fail, you have to leave immediately.
To these injunctions every one doth swear That comes to hazard for my worthless self.	Everyone who comes to gamble on winning me has to swear to these three rules.
And so have I addressed me.	Okay, I’m ready.
Fortune now To my heart’s hope!	I hope luck will give me what my heart hopes for!
Gold, silver, and base lead.	Gold, silver, and common lead.
Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.” You shall look fairer ere I give or hazard.	He who chooses me must give and risk all he has.” You’d have to be more attractive for me to give or risk anything for you.
What says the golden chest?	What does the golden box say?
Ha, let me see.	Hmm, let me see:
Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour Draws on apace; four happy days bring in Another moon; but, O, methinks, how slow This old moon wanes!	Now, fair Hippolyta, the time for our wedding is very close; Just four more happy days until the new moon.
Four days will quickly steep themselves in night; Four nights will quickly dream away the time; And then the moon, like to a silver bow New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night Of our solemnities.	Four days will quickly dissolve into four nights; Four nights will quickly dream away the time; And then the moon, like a silver slice in the heavens, Will light the night of our wedding solemnities.
Go, Philostrate, Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments; Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth; Turn melancholy forth to funerals; The pale companion is not for our pomp.	Go, Philostrate, Stir up the young people of Athens to start swinging; Get the party spirit going; Turn sadness back to the funerals — No sadness at our parties.
Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword, And won thy love doing thee injuries; But I will wed thee in another key, With pomp, with triumph, and with revelling.	Hippolyta, I got you by waging war with you, And made you love me by doing you injuries; But I will marry you in a different way, With pomp, with triumph, and with partying!
Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke!	Regards to Theseus, our renowned duke!
And, my gracious duke, Be it so she will not here before your Grace Consent to marry with Demetrius, I beg the ancient privilege of Athens: As she is mine, I may dispose of her; Which shall be either to this gentleman Or to her death, according to our law Immediately provided in that case.	Since she belongs to me, I may dispose of her, Which shall be either to this gentleman Or to her death, according to our law Which is fit to these circumstances.
What say you, Hermia?	What do you say, Hermia?
Be advis'd, fair maid.	Be careful, fair maid.
To you your father should be as a god; One that composed your beauties; yea, and one To whom you are but as a form in wax, By him imprinted, and within his power To leave the figure, or disfigure it.	To you your father should be as a god, A god that created your beauty, yes, and a god Who sees you as a piece of wax that he has imprinted, And it is within his power to leave the wax as it is, Or to disfigure it.
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.	Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.
So is Lysander.	So is Lysander.
In himself he is; But in this kind, wanting your father's voice, The other must be held the worthier.	In any other case, he is.
I would my father look'd but with my eyes.	I wish my father could see with my eyes.
Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.	No, you must see with your father’s eyes.
I do entreat your Grace to pardon me.	I beg your grace to pardon me.
Either to die the death, or to abjure For ever the society of men.	Either to die or to swear to avoid The society of men forever.
Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires, Know of your youth, examine well your blood, Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice, You can endure the livery of a nun, For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd, To live a barren sister all your life, Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.	Therefore, fair Hermia, think about what you’re doing, Think about how young you are, examine your choices well, Whether, if you don’t take your father's choice, You can endure life in a convent, To be shut up in a cloister, To live a childless nun all your life, Chanting faint hymns to the cold, fruitless moon.
Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood To undergo such maiden pilgrimage; But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd Than that which, withering on the virgin thorn Grows, lives, and dies, in single blessedness.	Those who can discipline themselves to undertake Such a heavenly path for piety are blessed three times; But those who are in a convent to avoid marriage Grow, live, and die, in single blessedness.
So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord, Ere I will yield my virgin patent up Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke My soul consents not to give sovereignty.	Well, that’s how I will grow, live, and die, my lord, Before I will give up my virginity To his lordship.
Take time to pause; and by the next new moon— The sealing-day betwixt my love and me For everlasting bond of fellowship,— Upon that day either prepare to die For disobedience to your father's will, Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would, Or on Diana's altar to protest For aye austerity and single life.	Take time to think about it; and, by the next new moon,— The wedding day of my love and me, For the everlasting bond of fellowship,— On that day either prepare to die Because you have disobeyed your father's will; Or else marry Demetrius, as your father wants you to; Or accept the austerity and single life of a nun.
Relent, sweet Hermia; and, Lysander, yield Thy crazed title to my certain right.	Give in, sweet Hermia;—and, Lysander, give up Your crazy claim to my future bride.
Scornful Lysander!	Scornful Lysander!
True, he hath my love; And what is mine my love shall render him; And she is mine; and all my right of her I do estate unto Demetrius.	Yes, Demetrius has my approval; And everything I own I will leave to him; And she is mine; and all my rights concerning her, I leave to Demetrius.
I am, my lord, as well derived as he, As well possess'd; my love is more than his; My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd, If not with vantage, as Demetrius'; And, which is more than all these boasts can be, I am belov'd of beauteous Hermia.	I am, my lord, as well born as he is, As rich; my love is better than his; My fortunes, no matter which way you look at it, Are as good as Demetrius'; And, furthermore, which is more important than all these qualities, Hermia loves me too!
Why should not I then prosecute my right?	Why shouldn’t I pursue Hermia?
Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head, Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena, And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes, Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry, Upon this spotted and inconstant man.	Demetrius, I'll swear it on his head, Pursued Nedar's daughter, Helena, the same way, And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, loves, Devoutly loves, loves to the point of divine worship, This spotted and inconstant man.
Come, my Hippolyta; what cheer, my love?	are you okay, my love?
Demetrius and Egeus, go along; I must employ you in some business Against our nuptial, and confer with you Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.	Demetrius and Egeus, go ahead; I must ask you to do a few things about the wedding, And meet with you about some issues that affect you.
With duty and desire we follow you.	We follow you, because we should and because we want to.
How now, my love!	What’s the matter, my love!
Why is your cheek so pale?	Why do you look so pale?
How chance the roses there do fade so fast?	Why do the roses in your cheeks fade so fast?
Ay me!	Oh dear!
too high to be enthrall'd to low.	I am too good to be in love with someone so low!
Or else misgraffed in respect of years— O spite!	Or else mismatched in terms of years;— Oh spite!

Give me your hands, if we be friends, And Robin shall restore amends.	Let’s have your applause, if we are friends, And Robin shall make good on his promise.
So, with two seeming bodies but one heart, Two of the first, like coats in heraldry, Due but to one and crownèd with one crest.	We seemed to have two separate bodies, but we had one heart.
And will you rent our ancient love asunder To join with men in scorning your poor friend?	Do you want to destroy our old friendship by joining these men to insult your poor friend?
It is not friendly, ’tis not maidenly.	It’s not friendly, and it’s not ladylike.
Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it, Though I alone do feel the injury.	All women would be angry with you for doing it, even though I’m the only one who’s hurt by it.
I scorn you not.	I’m not insulting you.
It seems that you scorn me.	It sounds more like you’re insulting me.
Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn, To follow me and praise my eyes and face?	Didn’t you send Lysander, as an insult, to follow me around praising my eyes and my face?
And made your other love, Demetrius— Who even but now did spurn me with his foot— To call me goddess, nymph, divine, and rare, Precious, celestial?	Haven’t you made your other love, Demetrius—who kicked me with his foot not long ago—call me a goddess and a divine, rare, precious, heavenly creature?

This you should pity rather than despise.	You should pity me for that reason, not hate me.
I understand not what you mean by this.	I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Ay, do.	Oh, fine.
Persever, counterfeit sad looks, Make mouths upon me when I turn my back, Wink each at other, hold the sweet jest up— This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.	All right, go ahead, keep up your little game, pretend to be sympathetic, but then nudge each other and wink and make faces at me when I turn my back.
If you have any pity, grace, or manners, You would not make me such an argument.	If you had any sense of pity, or manners, you wouldn’t pretend to fight over me like this.

Tis partly my own fault, Which death or absence soon shall remedy.	It’s partly my own fault, since I followed you here.
Stay, gentle Helena.	Stay, lovely Helena.
Hear my excuse.	Listen to my excuse.
My love, my life, my soul, fair Helena!	My love, my life, my soul, beautiful Helena!
Oh, excellent!	That’s a good one.
Thou canst compel no more than she entreat.	You can’t force me any more than Hermia can beg me.
Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers.— Helen, I love thee.	Your threats are no stronger than her whining.—Helena, I love you.
By my life, I do.	I swear I do.
I swear by that which I will lose for thee To prove him false that says I love thee not.	I’ll give my life for you, just to prove this guy wrong when he says I don’t love you.
I say I love thee more than he can do.	I say that I love you more than he does.
If thou say so, withdraw and prove it too.	If that’s what you say, go fight a duel with me and prove it.
Lysander, whereto tends all this?	Lysander, where are you going with all this?
Why are you grown so rude?	Why have you gotten so rude?
Thy love?	Your darling?
Out, tawny Tartar, out!	Get out, you dark-skinned gypsy!
Out, loathèd medicine!	Get out, you horrible poison.
O hated potion, hence!	Get out!
Do you not jest?	Are you joking?
Yes, sooth, and so do you.	Of course he is, and so are you.
Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee.	Demetrius, I’m ready to fight you as promised.
I would I had your bond, for I perceive A weak bond holds you.	I wish we had a signed legal contract.
I’ll not trust your word.	I don’t trust you.
Although I hate her, I’ll not harm her so.	Sure, I hate her, but I wouldn’t hurt her.
Ay, by my life, And never did desire to see thee more.	I certainly did, and I never wanted to see you again.
Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt.	So stop hoping and wondering what I mean.
Be certain, nothing truer.	I’ve spelled it out for you clearly.
O me!	Oh, no!
Fine, i' faith!	Oh, that’s very nice!
Have you no modesty, no maiden shame, No touch of bashfulness?	You ought to be ashamed of yourself!
Puppet”?	Puppet”?
Why so?—Ay, that way goes the game.	Why “puppet”?—Oh, I see where this is going.
How low am I, thou painted maypole?	So how short am I, you painted barber pole?
Speak.	Tell me.
How low am I?	How short am I?
Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.	Good Hermia, please don’t act so bitter toward me.
He followed you.	He followed you.
For love I followed him.	And I followed him because I loved him.
But he hath chid me hence and threatened me To strike me, spurn me—nay, to kill me too.	But he told me to get lost and threatened to hit me, kick me—even kill me.
Let me go.	Please let me go.
You see how simple and how fond I am.	You see how naïve and foolish I’ve been.
Why, get you gone!	Well, get out of here then!
Who is ’t that hinders you?	What’s keeping you?
A foolish heart, that I leave here behind.	My stupid heart, which I’m leaving behind here.
What, with Lysander?	What, you’re leaving it with Lysander?
With Demetrius.	No, with Demetrius.
Be not afraid.	Don’t be afraid.
She shall not harm thee, Helena.	She can’t hurt you, Helena.
She was a vixen when she went to school.	She was a hellcat in school.
And though she be but little, she is fierce.	And she’s fierce, even though she’s little.
Little” again?	Little” again?
Nothing but “low” and “little”!— Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?	Nothing but “little” and “short”!— Why are you letting her insult me like this?
Let me come to her.	Let me at her!.
What cheer, my love?— Demetrius and Egeus, go along.	How are you, my love?—Demetrius and Egeus, come with us.
I must employ you in some business Against our nuptial and confer with you Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.	I want you to do some things for our wedding, and I also want to discuss something that concerns you both.
With duty and desire we follow you.	We’re following you not only because it is our duty, but also because we want to.
How now, my love?	What’s going on, my love?
Why is your cheek so pale?	Why are you so pale?
How chance the roses there do fade so fast?	Why have your rosy cheeks faded so quickly?
Belike for want of rain, which I could well Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.	Probably because my cheeks' roses needed rain, which I could easily give them with all the tears in my eyes.
Ay me!	Oh, honey!
For aught that I could ever read, Could ever hear by tale or history, The course of true love never did run smooth.	Listen, in books they say that true love always faces obstacles.
But either it was different in blood—	Either the lovers have different social standings—
Let her alone.	Leave Hermia alone.
Speak not of Helena.	Don’t talk about Helena.
Take not her part.	Don’t take Helena’s side.
For if thou dost intend Never so little show of love to her, Thou shalt aby it.	If you continue treating Hermia so badly, you’ll pay for it.
Now she holds me not.	Hermia’s not holding onto me anymore.
Now follow, if thou darest, to try whose right, Of thine or mine, is most in Helena.	Follow me if you’re brave enough, and we’ll fight over Helena.
Follow”?	Follow”?
Nay, I’ll go with thee, cheek by jowl.	No, I’ll walk right next to you, side by side.
You, mistress, all this coil is long of you.	All this fighting is because of you.
Nay, go not back.	Stay where you are.
I am amazed and know not what to say.	I don’t know what to say.
Believe me, King of Shadows, I mistook.	Believe me, King of Illusions, I made a mistake.
Did not you tell me I should know the man By the Athenian garment he had on?	Didn’t you tell me that I’d be able to recognize the man by the Athenian clothes he was wearing?
And so far blameless proves my enterprise, That I have 'nointed an Athenian’s eyes.	So far I’ve done exactly what I was supposed to do—I put the love potion on an Athenian’s eyes.
And so far am I glad it so did sort, As this their jangling I esteem a sport.	And so far I’m pleased with the way things have turned out, since I find all of this commotion very entertaining.
Thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight.	As you can see, these lovers are looking for a place to fight.
Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night.	Hurry up, Robin, and make the night dark and cloudy.
The starry welkin cover thou anon With drooping fog as black as Acheron, And lead these testy rivals so astray As one come not within another’s way.	Cover the sky with a low-hanging fog, as dark as hell, and get these overeager rivals so completely lost in the woods that they can’t run into each other.
My fairy lord, this must be done with haste.	We’ve got to act fast, my lord of the fairies.
But we are spirits of another sort.	I like the morning.
I with the morning’s love have oft made sport, And like a forester the groves may tread Even till the eastern gate, all fiery red, Opening on Neptune with fair blessèd beams, Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.	I often wander around in the woods like a forest ranger until the sun rises in the fiery red sky over the ocean, turning the salty green water to gold.
But notwithstanding, haste.	But you should hurry anyway.
Make no delay.	Don’t delay.
We may effect this business yet ere day.	We still have time to get all of this done before daybreak.
Up and down, up and down,  I will lead them up and down.	Up and down, up and down, I will lead them up and down.

Goblin, lead them up and down.	Goblin, lead them up and down.
Here comes one.	Here comes one of them now.
Where art thou, proud Demetrius?	Where are you, Demetrius, you arrogant bastard?
Speak thou now.	Say something.
Lysander, speak again!	Lysander, say something!
Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?	You coward, did you run away from me?
Speak!	Say something!
In some bush?	Are you behind some bush?
Where dost thou hide thy head?	Where are you hiding?
Yea, art thou there?	Are you there?
He goes before me and still dares me on.	He’s walking ahead of me, and he keeps daring me to follow him.
When I come where he calls, then he is gone.	When I reach the place he’s calling from, he disappears.
The villain is much lighter-heeled than I. I followed fast, but faster he did fly, That fallen am I in dark uneven way,	This villain is much quicker than I am.
And here will rest me.	I’ll rest here.
Where art thou now?	Where are you now?
Nay, then, thou mock’st me.	No, you’re just taunting me.
Thou shalt buy this dear If ever I thy face by daylight see.	You’ll pay for this if I ever see you face-to-face in the daylight.
Now go thy way.	Go wherever you want.
O weary night, O long and tedious night, Abate thy hours.	Oh, what a long, tedious, exhausting night!

Come one more.	We’re still waiting for one more.

Here she comes, cursed and sad.	Ah, here she comes, angry and sad.
Cupid is a knavish lad  Thus to make poor females mad.	Cupid is a bad boy for making poor women go crazy like this.

Heavens shield Lysander if they mean a fray!	If they do fight, I hope Lysander is safe!

I must to the barber’s, monsieur, for methinks I am marvelous hairy about the face.	I should go to the barber’s, monsieur, because I think I’m getting really hairy around the face.
And I am such a tender ass, if my hair do but tickle me, I must scratch.	And I’m such a sensitive ass that if my hair even tickles me a little, I need to scratch.

Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle of hay.	Or maybe I’ve got a hankering for a bundle of hay.
Good hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow.	There’s nothing like good hay, really sweet hay.
I have a venturous fairy that shall seek The squirrel’s hoard and fetch thee new nuts.	I have an adventurous fairy who’ll go seek out the squirrel’s secret stash and get you some fresh nuts.
I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas.	I’d rather have a handful or two of dried peas.
But, I pray you, let none of your people stir me.	But please don’t let any of your people wake me up.
I have an exposition of sleep come upon me.	I really want to sleep now.
Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.	Go to sleep, and I will wrap my arms around you.
Oh, how I love thee!	Oh, how I love you!
How I dote on thee!	I’m so crazy about you!
Welcome, good Robin.	Welcome, good Robin.
Seest thou this sweet sight?	Do you see this sweet sight?
Her dotage now I do begin to pity.	Now I’m starting to pity Titania for being so infatuated.
For, meeting her of late behind the wood, Seeking sweet favors from this hateful fool, I did upbraid her and fall out with her.	I ran into her recently at the edge of the forest, looking for sweet presents for this hateful idiot, and I scolded her and argued with her.
For she his hairy temples then had rounded With a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers, And that same dew, which sometime on the buds Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls, Stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.	She had put a wreath of fresh, fragrant flowers around his hairy forehead, and the drops of dew that lay in the center of the flowers made the flowers look like they were crying with shame to be decorating the head of that ugly jackass.
And now I have the boy, I will undo This hateful imperfection of her eyes.	And now that I have the boy, I’ll undo the spell that makes her vision so disgustingly wrong.
And, gentle Puck, take this transformèd scalp From off the head of this Athenian swain, That, he awaking when the other do, May all to Athens back again repair And think no more of this night’s accidents But as the fierce vexation of a dream.	And, gentle Puck, take this transformed ass’s head off of the head of that Athenian man, so that when he wakes up at the same time as the rest of them do, they can all go back to Athens.
But first I will release the fairy queen.	But first I’ll release the fairy queen from the spell.
Now, my Titania, wake you, my sweet queen.	Now, Titania, wake up, my sweet queen.
There lies your love.	There’s your boyfriend, sleeping right over there.
How came these things to pass?	How did this happen?
Oh, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!	Oh, I hate looking at his face now!
Silence awhile.—Robin, take off this head.— Titania, music call, and strike more dead Than common sleep of all these five the sense.	Be quiet for a while.—Robin, take off his donkey head.—Titania, get the fairies to play some music, and make these five people sleep more soundly than humans have ever slept before.
Music, ho!	Music!
Music such as charmeth sleep!	Play the kind of music that puts people to sleep.
Sound, music!—Come, my queen, take hands with me, And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.	Play the music.—Take my hands, my queen, and we’ll lull these people to sleep with our soft dancing.
Too old to be engaged to young.	Being too old to marry someone young.
Or else it stood upon the choice of friends— O hell, to choose love by another’s eyes!	Or else their guardians and advisors said no— What hell, to have your love life determined by someone else!
So quick bright things come to confusion.	That’s how intense things like love are quickly destroyed.
If then true lovers have been ever crossed, It stands as an edict in destiny.	If true lovers are always thwarted, then it must be a rule of fate.
A good persuasion.	That’s the right attitude.
Therefore, hear me, Hermia.	So, listen, Hermia.
I have a widow aunt, a dowager Of great revenue, and she hath no child.	I have an aunt who is a widow, who’s very rich and doesn’t have any children.
From Athens is her house remote seven leagues, And she respects me as her only son.	She lives about twenty miles from Athens, and she thinks of me as a son.
There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee.	I could marry you there, gentle Hermia, where the strict laws of Athens can’t touch us.
And to that place the sharp Athenian law Cannot pursue us.	So here’s the plan.
Fairy King, attend, and mark.	Listen, Fairy King.
I do hear the morning lark.	I can hear the lark singing.
Then, my queen, in silence sad, Trip we after the night’s shade.	Morning’s here.
Come, my lord, and in our flight Tell me how it came this night That I sleeping here was found With these mortals on the ground.	While we’re walking, you can tell me how I ended up sleeping on the ground with these humans last night.
Go, one of you, find out the forester.	One of you go find the forest ranger.
Uncouple in the western valley.	Unleash the dogs in the western valley.
Let them go.	Let them go.
Dispatch, I say, and find the forester.	Now go find the forest ranger.
We will, fair queen, up to the mountain’s top, And mark the musical confusion Of hounds and echo in conjunction.	My beautiful queen, we’ll go up the mountain and listen to the hounds as their barking echoes in the cliffs and sounds like music.
I was with Hercules and Cadmus once, When in a wood of Crete they bayed the bear With hounds of Sparta.	I was with the heroes Hercules and Cadmus once, when their Spartan hunting dogs cornered a bear.
The skies, the fountains, every region near Seemed all one mutual cry.	The forests, the skies, the mountains, everything around us seemed to echo the barks of the hounds.
I never heard So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.	I’d never heard such raucous music, such pleasant thunder.
I wonder of their being here together.	I don’t understand why they’re all here together.
But speak, Egeus.	But tell me, Egeus.
Is not this the day That Hermia should give answer of her choice?	Isn’t today the day when Hermia has to tell us her decision about whether she’ll marry Demetrius?
It is, my lord.	It is, my lord.
Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.	Go tell the hunters to blow their horns and wake them up.
Good morrow, friends.	Good morning, my friends.
Saint Valentine is past.	Valentine’s Day is over.
Begin these woodbirds but to couple now?	Are you lovebirds only starting to pair up now?
Pardon, my lord.	Forgive us, my lord.
I pray you all, stand up.	Please, all of you, stand up.
My lord, I shall reply amazèdly, Half sleep, half waking.	My lord, what I say may be a little confused, since I’m half asleep and half awake.
But as yet, I swear, I cannot truly say how I came here.	I swear, at the moment I really couldn’t tell you how I ended up here.
But as I think—for truly would I speak, And now do I bethink me, so it is— I came with Hermia hither.	But I think—I want to tell you the truth, and now that I think about it, I think this is true—I came here with Hermia.
And all the faith, the virtue of my heart, The object and the pleasure of mine eye, Is only Helena.	Now the only person I love, and believe in, and want to look at, is Helena.
To her, my lord, Was I betrothed ere I saw Hermia.	I was engaged to her before I ever met Hermia.
Fair lovers, you are fortunately met.	You pretty lovers are lucky you met me here.
Of this discourse we more will hear anon.— Egeus, I will overbear your will.	We’ll talk more about this later.—Egeus, I’m overriding your wishes.
Away with us to Athens.	Come with us to Athens.
Three and three, We’ll hold a feast in great solemnity.	We three couples will celebrate with a sumptuous feast.
Are you sure That we are awake?	Are you sure we’re awake?
It seems to me That yet we sleep, we dream.	It seems to me like we’re still sleeping, still dreaming.
And he did bid us follow to the temple.	And he told us to follow him to the temple.
Why then, we are awake.	Well, then, we’re awake.
It shall be called “Bottom’s Dream” because it hath no bottom.	I’ll call it “Bottom’s Dream” because it’s so deep that it has no bottom.
And I will sing it in the latter end of a play before the duke.	And I’ll sing it for the duke in the intermission of a play.
Peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it at her death.	Or maybe, to make it even more lovely, I’ll sing it when the heroine dies.
Have you sent to Bottom’s house?	Have you sent anyone to Bottom’s house?
Is he come home yet?	Has he come home yet?
He cannot be heard of.	No one’s heard from him.
Out of doubt he is transported.	I’m sure he’s been kidnapped.
If he come not, then the play is marred.	If he doesn’t show up, the play is ruined.
It goes not forward.	It won’t go on.
Doth it?	Will it?
It is not possible.	No, it would be impossible.
No, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in Athens.	He’s quite simply the smartest working-man in Athens.
Yea, and the best person too.	Yes, and the best looking too.
And he is a very paramour for a sweet voice.	And his voice is the paramour of sweetness.
You must say “paragon.” A “paramour” is, God bless us, a thing of naught.	You mean “paragon.” A  The duke’s leaving the temple.
Masters, the duke is coming from the temple, and there is two or three lords and ladies more married.	Two or three more lords and ladies have been married too.
If our sport had gone forward, we had all been made men.	If we’d been able to put on our play, we would have had it made.
O sweet bully Bottom!	Oh that great, funny guy, Bottom!
Thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life.	He would have gotten a pension of six pence a day for his whole life.
He could not have ’scaped sixpence a day.	Six pence a day would’ve been forced on him.
An the duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I’ll be hanged.	I’ll be damned if the duke wouldn’t have given him six pence a day for playing Pyramus.
He would have deserved it.	And he would have deserved it too.
Where are these hearts?	Where are my good fellows?
Bottom!	Bottom!
O most courageous day!	Oh, how wonderful to see you!
O most happy hour!	Oh, what a relief!
I will tell you everything, right as it fell out.	I’ll tell you everything exactly as it happened.
Let us hear, sweet Bottom.	Tell us, Bottom.
Not a word of me.	No, you won’t get a word out of me.
All that I will tell you is that the duke hath dined.	All I’ll tell you is that the duke has had dinner already.
Get your apparel together, good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your pumps.	Now it’s time to get your costumes together.
Meet presently at the palace.	Meet me at the palace as soon as possible.
Every man look o'er his part.	Look over your lines again.
And most dear actors, eat no onions nor garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath.	And no one eat any onions or garlic.
And I do not doubt but to hear them say, “It is a sweet comedy.” No more words.	If we have sweet-smelling breath, I’m sure they’ll say “it’s a sweet play.” Now no more talking.
Away, go away!	Get busy, go!
Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of.	These lovers are saying some strange things, Theseus.
I never may believe These antique fables nor these fairy toys.	I’ll never believe any of these old legends or fairy tales.
The lunatic, the lover, and the poet Are of imagination all compact.	Lunatics, lovers, and poets all are ruled by their overactive imaginations.
But all the story of the night told over, And all their minds transfigured so together, More witnesseth than fancy’s images And grows to something of great constancy, But, howsoever, strange and admirable.	Their story is bizarre and astounding, but it’s solid and consistent.
Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.— Joy, gentle friends!	Here come the lovers, laughing happily.—I wish you joy, my friends!
Come now, what masques, what dances shall we have To wear away this long age of three hours Between our after-supper and bedtime?	Now, what kind of entertainment do we have to fill up the long three hours between dinner and bedtime?
Where is our usual manager of mirth?	Where is our entertainment director?
What revels are in hand?	What performances have been prepared?
Call Philostrate.	Let me see Philostrate.
Here, mighty Theseus.	Here I am, Theseus.
What masque, what music?	Which plays, what music?
How shall we beguile The lazy time if not with some delight?	How will we pass the time without some entertainment?
Keep promise, love.	Keep your promise, my love.
Look, here comes Helena.	Look, here comes Helena.
Godspeed, fair Helena!	Hello, beautiful Helena!
Whither away?	Where are you going?
Call you me “fair”?	Did you just call me “beautiful”?
That “fair” again unsay.	Take it back.
Demetrius loves your fair.	You’re the beautiful one as far as Demetrius is concerned.
O happy fair!	Oh, you’re so lucky!
Your eyes are lodestars, and your tongue’s sweet air More tunable than lark to shepherd’s ear When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.	Your eyes are like stars, and your voice is more musical than a lark’s song is to a shepherd in the springtime.
Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated, The rest I’d give to be to you translated.	If the world were mine, I’d give it all up—everything except Demetrius—to be you.
The thrice three Muses mourning for the death  Of learning, late deceased in beggary.” That is some satire, keen and critical, Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.	The nine Muses mourning the death of learning and scholarship.” That’s some sharp, critical satire, and it’s not appropriate for a wedding.
Tedious” and “brief”?	Short but still tedious?
That is hot ice and wondrous strange snow.	That’s like hot ice and strange snow.
How shall we find the concord of this discord?	How can this drama be so many contradictory things?
A play there is, my lord, some ten words long, Which is as brief as I have known a play.	It’s a play about ten words long, which is the shortest play I’ve ever heard of.
For in all the play There is not one word apt, one player fitted.	In the entire play, not one word is well-written, and not one of the actors is right for his part.
For Pyramus therein doth kill himself.	It’s tragic because Pyramus kills himself.
Which, when I saw rehearsed, I must confess, Made mine eyes water—but more merry tears The passion of loud laughter never shed.	I have to admit that when I saw his suicide during rehearsal, I had tears in my eyes—but they were tears of laughter.
What are they that do play it?	Who are the actors?
And we will hear it.	So let’s see it.
No, my noble lord.	No, my noble lord.
It is not for you.	This play isn’t right for you.
I have heard it over, And it is nothing, nothing in the world— Unless you can find sport in their intents, Extremely stretched and conned with cru 'l pain To do you service.	I’ve seen the whole thing, and it’s completely worthless—unless you think their bad acting and their misremembered lines—which they memorized so painfully—are funny.
I will hear that play.	I’ll watch this play.
Go, bring them in.—And take your places, ladies.	Come on, bring them in.
Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.	You won’t see anything like that, sweetheart.
He says they can do nothing in this kind.	He just said that they’re no good at acting.
Where I have come, great clerks have purposèd To greet me with premeditated welcomes, Where I have seen them shiver and look pale, Make periods in the midst of sentences, Throttle their practiced accent in their fears, And in conclusion dumbly have broke off, Not paying me a welcome.	In my travels, great scholars have come up to me, meaning to greet me with well-rehearsed welcoming speeches, and I have seen them tremble and turn pale, and pause inappropriately in the middle of their sentences, and botch their well-rehearsed tones of voice because they’re so nervous, and then break off abruptly at the end, without actually welcoming me.
Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity In least speak most, to my capacity.	Therefore, love and tongue-tied simplicity can say the most even when they’re saying the least, in my opinion.
So please your grace, the Prologue is addressed.	Your grace, the person who is going to deliver the prologue is ready.
Let him approach.	Let him come forward.
If we offend, it is with our good will.	If we happen to offend you, it’s because we want to.
That you should think we come not to offend, But with good will.	We don’t want you to think we came here to offend you, except that we want to offend you with our good intentions.
Consider then we come but in despite.	Please keep in mind we’re only here out of spite.
We do not come as minding to contest you, Our true intent is.	We don’t come here with the intention of making you happy.
All for your delight We are not here.	We’re absolutely not here to delight you.
That you should here repent you, The actors are at hand, and by their show You shall know all that you are like to know.	By watching their show, you’ll find out everything you’re likely to know.
This fellow doth not stand upon points.	This guy doesn’t pay much attention to punctuation.
He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt.	He rode that prologue like a wild horse.
He knows not the stop.	He didn’t know how to stop it.
A good moral, my lord: it is not enough to speak, but to speak true.	The moral of this story is that it’s not enough to speak; you have to speak grammatically.
His speech was like a tangled chain.	His speech was like a tangled chain.
Who is next?	Who’s next?
I wonder if the lion be to speak.	I wonder if the lion’s going to talk.
No wonder, my lord.	It wouldn’t surprise me, my lord.
Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?	Can you imagine cement and stone talking better?
It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard discourse, my lord.	It’s the smartest partition I’ve ever heard speak, my lord.
Pyramus draws near the wall.	Pyramus is coming up to the wall.
Silence!	Be quiet!
I fear my Thisbe’s promise is forgot!— And thou, O Wall, O sweet, O lovely Wall, That stand’st between her father’s ground and mine.	I’m afraid my Thisbe has forgotten her promise!—And you, oh Wall, oh sweet, oh lovely Wall, you stand between her father’s property and mine, you Wall, oh Wall, oh sweet and lovely Wall.
Jove shield thee well for this!	God bless you for doing this.
But what see I?	But what’s this I see?
No Thisbe do I see.	I don’t see any Thisbe.
O wicked Wall through whom I see no bliss!	Oh wicked wall, through which I don’t see any happiness!
Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me!	Damn your stones for disappointing me like this!
The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.	Since the wall is conscious, it should curse back at him.
I see a voice.	I see a voice!
Now will I to the chink, To spy an I can hear my Thisbe’s face.	I’ll go to the hole to see if I can hear my Thisbe’s face.
Thisbe?	Thisbe?
My love thou art, my love, I think.	You are my love, my love, I think.
Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover’s grace.	I’m your love, no matter what you think.
Wilt thou at Ninny’s tomb meet me straightway?	Will you meet me right away at Ninny’s grave?
Tide life, tide death, I come without delay.	Neither death nor life will stop me from coming.
Thus have I, Wall, my part dischargèd so.	I, Wall, have done my part.
And, being done, thus Wall away doth go.	Now that I’m done, Wall can go away.
This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.	This is the silliest thing I’ve ever seen.
The best in this kind are but shadows, and the worst are no worse if imagination amend them.	The best plays are still only illusions, and the worst are just as good, if you just use your imagination to fill them in.
It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.	In that case it’s your imagination that’s interesting, not the play.
Here come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion.	Look, here come two noble animals, a man and a lion.
A very gentle beast, of a good conscience.	Ah, it’s a sensitive animal, with a good conscience.
This lion is a very fox, for his valor.	He’s as brave as a fox.
True.	True.
And a goose for his discretion.	And as wise as a goose.
Not so, my lord.	Oh, that’s not true, my lord.
For his valor cannot carry his discretion, and the fox carries the goose.	He’s not brave enough to be wise.
His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valor, for the goose carries not the fox.	He’s not wise enough to be brave.
It is well.	Anyway, he is what he is.
Leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the moon.	Let’s listen to the moon.
This lanthorn doth the hornèd moon present.	This lantern represents the moon.
Myself the man i' th' moon do seem to be— This is the greatest error of all the rest.	I myself am playing the man in the moon— Well then, that’s the biggest mistake of all.
The man should be put into the lanthorn.	The man should be inside the lantern.
How is it else the “man i' th' moon”?	How else is he the “man in the moon”?
He dares not come there for the candle.	He can’t go in there because of the candle.
For you see, it is already in snuff.	It’s too hot.
I am aweary of this moon.	I’m tired of this moon.
Proceed, Moon.	Go ahead, Moon.
All that I have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon; I, the man in the moon; this thornbush, my thornbush; and this dog, my dog.	All I wanted to tell you is that the lantern is the moon, I’m the man in the moon, this thornbush is my thornbush, and this dog is my dog.
Why, all these should be in the lanthorn, for all these are in the moon.—But silence!	Well, all of these should be in the lantern, because they’re all in the moon.
Here comes Thisbe.	But be quiet, here comes Thisbe.
This is old Ninny’s tomb.	This is old Ninny’s tomb.
Where is my love?	But where is my love?
Well roared, Lion!	Good roaring, Lion!
Well run, Thisbe!	Good running, Thisbe!
Well shone, Moon!—Truly, the moon shines with a good grace.	Good shining, Moon!—Really, the Moon shines very well.
Well moused, Lion!	That’s good, Lion!
O, teach me how you look and with what art You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.	Oh, teach me how you look the way you do, and which tricks you used to make Demetrius fall in love with you.
I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.	I frown at him, but he still loves me.
Oh, that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!	Oh, if only my smiles could inspire love as effectively as your frowns!
I give him curses, yet he gives me love.	I curse him, but he loves me.
Oh, that my prayers could such affection move!	If only my prayers could inspire that kind of affection!
The more I hate, the more he follows me.	The more I hate him, the more he follows me around.
The more I love, the more he hateth me.	The more I love him, the more he hates me.
His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.	It’s not my fault he acts like that, Helena.
None, but your beauty.	That’s true, it’s your beauty’s fault.
Would that fault were mine!	I wish I had a fault like that!
Take comfort.	Don’t worry.
He no more shall see my face.	He won’t see my face ever again.
Lysander and myself will fly this place.	Lysander and I are running away from here.
Before the time I did Lysander see Seemed Athens as a paradise to me.	Before I saw Lysander, Athens seemed like paradise to me.
Oh, then, what graces in my love do dwell, That he hath turned a heaven unto a hell!	But Lysander’s so attractive that he’s turned heaven into hell!
Helen, to you our minds we will unfold.	Helena, we’ll tell you about our secret plan.
Tomorrow night when Phoebe doth behold Her silver visage in the watery glass, Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass (A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal), Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal.	Tomorrow night, when the moon shines on the water and decorates the grass with tiny beads of pearly light (the time of night that always hides runaway lovers), we plan to sneak out of Athens.
And then came Pyramus.	And then Pyramus showed up.
And so the lion vanished.	So the lion disappeared.
Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams.	Sweet Moon, I thank you for your sunny beams.
But mark, poor knight, What dreadful dole is here!	But, look, poor me, what a terrible tragedy is here!
Eyes, do you see?	Eyes, do you see?
How can it be?	How can it be?
O dainty duck!	Oh, dainty duck!
O dear!	Oh, dear!
O Fates, come, come, Cut thread and thrum.	Oh, Fate, come and cut the thread of my life.
Quail, crush, conclude, and quell!	Conquer, crush, conclude, and kill!
O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame?	Oh, Mother Nature, why did you create lions?
Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.	And so I’m dying.
Now am I dead.	Okay, now I’m dead.
Now die, die, die, die, die.	Now die, die, die, die, die.
With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove an ass.	With a doctor’s help he might recover and become an ass again.
Methinks she should not use a long one for such a Pyramus.	I don’t think a ridiculous Pyramus like that one deserves much moaning.
I hope she will be brief.	I hope she keeps it short.
She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.	Look, she’s spotted him with those sweet eyes of hers.
And thus she means, videlicet— Asleep, my love?	And now she’ll start moaning, of course— Are you asleep, my love?
What, dead, my dove?	What, are you dead, my dove?
O Pyramus, arise!	Oh, Pyramus, get up!
Speak, speak.	Speak, speak.
Quite dumb?	Can’t you talk?
Dead, dead?	Dead, dead?
A tomb Must cover thy sweet eyes.	The dirt of a grave must cover your sweet eyes!
These lily lips, This cherry nose, These yellow cowslip cheeks Are gone, are gone.	Your lily-white lips, your cherry-red nose, and your buttercup-yellow cheeks are gone, gone forever.
Lovers, make moan.	Lovers, moan and weep.
His eyes were green as leeks.	His eyes were as green as leeks.
O Sisters three, Come, come to me With hands as pale as milk.	Oh, Fate, come, come to me, with hands as pale as milk.
Lay them in gore, Since you have shore With shears his thread of silk.	Soak your hands in blood and gore, since you have cut the thread of his life with scissors.
Tongue, not a word.	Tongue, do not speak.
Come, trusty sword.	Come, trusty sword.
Come, blade, my breast imbrue.	Come, blade, drench my breast with blood.
Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.	Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.
Ay, and Wall too.	Yes, and Wall too.
No epilogue, I pray you, for your play needs no excuse.	No epilogue, please.
Never excuse—for when the players are all dead, there needs none to be blamed.	Never apologize—when the actors are all dead, no one can be blamed.
Marry, if he that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself in Thisbe’s garter, it would have been a fine tragedy.	As a matter of fact, if the playwright had played Pyramus and hanged himself with Thisbe’s belt, it would have been a very good tragedy.
And so it is, truly, and very notably discharged.	It’s a good tragedy, very well done.
But come, your Bergomask.	But come on, let’s see you do your dance.
Let your epilogue alone.	Forget your epilogue.
The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve.	The clock has chimed midnight.
Lovers, to bed.	Lovers, it’s time to go to bed.
Tis almost fairy time.	It’s almost fairy time.
Sweet friends, to bed.	Dear friends, let’s go to bed.
Through the house give glimmering light, By the dead and drowsy fire.	Let the dying fire shine a glimmering light throughout the house.
First, rehearse your song by rote, To each word a warbling note.	First rehearse your song from memory, and make sure each note is pretty.
Hand in hand with fairy grace Will we sing and bless this place.	We’ll all join hands and sing, and bless this place with our fairy grace.
If you pardon, we will mend.	If you forgive us, we’ll make everything all right.
And, as I am an honest Puck,  If we have unearnèd luck  Now to ’scape the serpent’s tongue,  We will make amends ere long.	I’m an honest Puck, and I swear that if we’re lucky enough not to get hissed at, we’ll make it up to you soon.
Else the Puck a liar call.	If not, then I’m a liar.
So good night unto you all.	So good night to everyone.
Give me your hands if we be friends,  And Robin shall restore amends.	Give me some applause, if we’re friends, and Robin will make everything up to you.
There my Lysander and myself shall meet.	From then on we’ll turn our backs on Athens.
And thence from Athens turn away our eyes To seek new friends and stranger companies.	We’ll look for new friends and keep the company of strangers.
Farewell, sweet playfellow.	Goodbye, old friend.
We must starve our sight From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.	We need to stay away from each other until midnight tomorrow.
I will, my Hermia.	I will, my Hermia.
Helena, adieu.	Goodbye, Helena.
As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!	I hope Demetrius comes to love you as much as you love him!
But what of that?	But so what?
Demetrius thinks not so.	Demetrius doesn’t think so, and that’s all that matters.
He will not know what all but he do know.	He refuses to admit what everyone else knows.
Things base and vile, holding no quantity, Love can transpose to form and dignity.	Love can make worthless things beautiful.
Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind.	When we’re in love, we don’t see with our eyes but with our minds.
And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.	That’s why paintings of Cupid, the god of love, always show him as blind.
Nor hath Love’s mind of any judgment taste— Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste.	And love doesn’t have good judgment either—Cupid, has wings and no eyes, so he’s bound to be reckless and hasty.
And therefore is Love said to be a child, Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.	That’s why they say love is a child.
Then to the wood will he tomorrow night Pursue her.	He’ll run after her.
Is all our company here?	Is everyone here?
First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on, then read the names of the actors, and so grow to a point.	First, Peter Quince, tell us what the play is about, then read the names of the actors, and then shut up.
Answer as I call you.—Nick Bottom, the weaver?	Answer when I call your name.—Nick Bottom, the weaver?
Ready.	Here.
Name what part I am for and proceed.	Tell me which part I’m going to play, then go on.
You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.	You, Nick Bottom, have been cast as Pyramus.
What is Pyramus?	What’s Pyramus?
I will condole in some measure.—To the rest.—Yet my chief humor is for a tyrant.	I’ll moan very believably.—Name the other actors.—But I’m really in the mood to play a tyrant.
I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a cat in to make all split.	I could do a great job with Hercules, or any other part that requires ranting and raving.
A lover is more condoling.	A lover would have to be weepier, of course.
Francis Flute, the bellows-mender?	Francis Flute, the bellows-repairman?
Here, Peter Quince.	Here, Peter Quince.
What is Thisbe?	Who’s Thisbe?
A wandering knight?	A knight on a quest?
It is the lady that Pyramus must love.	Thisbe is the lady Pyramus is in love with.
Nay, faith, let me not play a woman.	No, come on, don’t make me play a woman.
I have a beard coming.	I’m growing a beard.
That’s all one.	That doesn’t matter.
You shall play it in a mask, and you may speak as small as you will.	You’ll wear a mask, and you can make your voice as high as you want to.
An I may hide my face, let me play Thisbe too!	In that case, if I can wear a mask, let me play Thisbe too!
You must play Pyramus.—And Flute, you Thisbe.	Bottom, you’re Pyramus.—And Flute, you’re Thisbe.
Robin Starveling, the tailor?	Robin Starveling, the tailor?
Here, Peter Quince.	Here, Peter Quince.
Robin Starveling, you must play Thisbe’s mother.—Tom Snout, the tinker?	Robin Starveling, you’re going to play Thisbe’s mother.—Tom Snout, the handyman.
Here, Peter Quince.	Here, Peter Quince.
You, Pyramus' father.—Myself, Thisbe’s father.—Snug the joiner, you, the lion’s part.—And I hope here is a play fitted.	I hope this play is well cast now.
Have you the lion’s part written?	Do you have the lion’s part written down?
Pray you, if it be, give it me, for I am slow of study.	If you do, please give it to me, because I need to start learning the lines.
Let me play the lion too.	Let me play the lion too.
And that were enough to hang us all.	And that would get us all executed.
That would hang us, every mother’s son.	Yeah, that would get every single one of us executed.
I grant you, friends, if you should fright the ladies out of their wits, they would have no more discretion but to hang us.	Well, my friends, you’ve got to admit that if you scare the living daylights out of the ladies, they’d have no choice but to execute us.
For Pyramus is a sweet-faced man, a proper man as one shall see in a summer’s day, a most lovely, gentlemanlike man.	Because Pyramus is a good-looking man, the most handsome man that you could find on a summer’s day, a lovely gentlemanly man.
Therefore you must needs play Pyramus.	So you’re the only one who could play Pyramus.
Well, I will undertake it.	Well then, I’ll do it.
What beard were I best to play it in?	What kind of beard should I wear for the part?
Why, what you will.	Whatever kind you want, I guess.
Four days will quickly steep themselves in night.	No, you’ll see, four days will quickly turn into four nights.
Four nights will quickly dream away the time.	And since we dream at night, time passes quickly then.
And then the moon, like to a silver bow New bent in heaven, shall behold the night Of our solemnities.	Finally the new moon, curved like a silver bow in the sky, will look down on our wedding celebration.
Turn melancholy forth to funerals.	Sadness is only appropriate for funerals.
The pale companion is not for our pomp.	We don’t want it at our festivities.
But I will wed thee in another key, With pomp, with triumph, and with reveling.	But I’ll marry you under different circumstances—with extravagant festivals, public festivities, and celebration.
Happy be Theseus, our renownèd duke.	Long live Theseus, our famous and respected duke!
I will discharge it in either your straw-color beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain beard, or your French crown-color beard, your perfect yellow.	I’ll play the part wearing either a straw-colored beard, or a sandy beard, or a red beard, or one of those bright yellow beards that’s the color of a French coin.
There will we rehearse, for if we meet in the city we shall be dogged with company, and our devices known.	It’s best to rehearse there, because if we do it here in the city, we’ll be bothered by crowds of people and everyone will know the plot of our play.
In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties such as our play wants.	Meanwhile, I’ll make a list of props that we’ll need for the play.
I pray you, fail me not.	Don’t leave me in the lurch.
We will meet, and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously.	We’ll be there, and there we’ll rehearse courageously and wonderfully, truly obscenely.
Adieu.	Goodbye.
At the duke’s oak we meet.	We’ll meet at the giant oak tree in the duke’s forest.
Enough.	Got it?
Hold, or cut bowstrings.	Be there, or don’t show your face again.
How now, spirit?	Hello, spirit!
Whither wander you?	Where are you going?
Over hill, over dale,  Thorough bush, thorough brier,  Over park, over pale,  Thorough flood, thorough fire.	I go over hills and valleys, through bushes and thorns, over parks and fenced-in spaces, through water and fire.
I do wander everywhere  Swifter than the moon’s sphere.	I wander everywhere faster than the moon revolves around the Earth.
And I serve the fairy queen  To dew her orbs upon the green.	I work for Titania, the Fairy Queen, and organize fairy dances for her in the grass.
The cowslips tall her pensioners be.	The cowslip flowers are her bodyguards.
In those freckles live their savors.	Their sweet smells come from those little freckles.
I must go seek some dewdrops here  And hang a pearl in every cowslip’s ear.	Now I have to go find some dewdrops and hang a pearl earring on every cowslip flower.
Farewell, thou lob of spirits.	Goodbye, you dumb old spirit.
I’ll be gone.	I’ve got to go.
Our queen and all our elves come here anon.	The queen and her elves will be here soon.
For Oberon is passing fell and wrath Because that she, as her attendant hath A lovely boy stolen from an Indian king.	He’s furious because she stole an adorable boy from an Indian king.
And jealous Oberon would have the child Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild.	He wants the child for himself, to accompany him on his wanderings through the wild forests.
But she perforce withholds the lovèd boy, Crowns him with flowers, and makes him all her joy.	Instead, she puts flowers in the boy’s hair and makes a fuss over him.
Those that “Hobgoblin” call you, and “sweet Puck,” You do their work, and they shall have good luck.	You do their work for them and give them good luck.
Are not you he?	That’s you, right?
Thou speak’st aright.	What you say is true.
I am that merry wanderer of the night.	That’s me you’re talking about, the playful wanderer of the night.
And sometime lurk I in a gossip’s bowl In very likeness of a roasted crab, And when she drinks, against her lips I bob And on her withered dewlap pour the ale.	When she takes a sip, I bob up against her lips and make her spill the drink all over her withered old neck.
Then slip I from her bum, down topples she, And “Tailor!” cries, and falls into a cough, And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh, And waxen in their mirth, and neeze, and swear A merrier hour was never wasted there.	But I slip from underneath her and she falls down, crying, “Ow, my butt!” and starts coughing, and then everyone laughs and has fun.
But, room, fairy!	But step aside, fairy!
Here comes Oberon.	Here comes Oberon.
And here my mistress.	And here’s my mistress, Titania.
Would that he were gone!	I wish he’d go away!
What, jealous Oberon?—Fairies, skip hence.	How  What, are you jealous, Oberon?—Fairies, let’s get out of here.
I have forsworn his bed and company.	I’ve sworn I’ll never sleep with him or talk to him again.
Tarry, rash wanton.	Wait just a minute, you brazen hussy.
Why art thou here, Come from the farthest step of India?	The only reason you left India was to come here and see that butch Amazon Hippolyta.
But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon, Your buskined mistress and your warrior love, To Theseus must be wedded, and you come To give their bed joy and prosperity.	She was your boot-wearing mistress and your warrior lover, and now that she’s getting married to Theseus, you’ve come to celebrate their marriage.
How canst thou thus for shame, Titania, Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?	How can you stand there shamelessly talking about me and Hippolyta, when you know that I know about your love for Theseus?
Glance at my credit with Hippolyta, Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night From Perigouna, whom he ravishèd?	Weren’t you the one who made him desert Perigouna in the middle of the night, right after he’d raped her?
And make him with fair Ægles break his faith, With Ariadne and Antiopa?	And weren’t you the one who made him cheat on all of his other girlfriends, like Aegles, Ariadne, and Antiopa?
These are the forgeries of jealousy.	These are nothing but jealous lies.
And never, since the middle summer’s spring, Met we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead, By pavèd fountain, or by rushy brook, Or in the beachèd margent of the sea, To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind, But with thy brawls thou hast disturbed our sport.	We haven’t been able to meet on a hill or in a valley, in the forest or a meadow, by a pebbly fountain or a rushing stream, or on the beach by the ocean without you disturbing us.
Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain, As in revenge, have sucked up from the sea Contagious fogs, which falling in the land Have every pelting river made so proud That they have overborne their continents.	And because you interrupt us so that we can’t dance for them, the winds have made fogs rise up out of the sea and fall down on the rivers so that the rivers flood, just to get revenge on you.
The ox hath therefore stretched his yoke in vain, The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn Hath rotted ere his youth attained a beard.	So all the work that oxen and farmers have done in plowing the fields has been for nothing, because the unripe grain has rotted before it was ripe.
The fold stands empty in the drownèd field, And crows are fatted with the murrain flock.	Sheep pens are empty in the middle of the flooded fields, and the crows get fat from eating the dead bodies of infected sheep.
Therefore the moon, the governess of floods, Pale in her anger, washes all the air, That rheumatic diseases do abound.	So the pale, angry moon, who controls the tides, fills the air with diseases.
The spring, the summer, The childing autumn, angry winter change Their wonted liveries, and the mazèd world, By their increase, now knows not which is which.	Spring, summer, fertile autumn and angry winter have all changed places, and now the confused world doesn’t know which is which.
And this same progeny of evils comes From our debate, from our dissension.	And this is all because of our argument.
We are their parents and original.	We are responsible for this.
Do you amend it then.	Do something about it, then.
It lies in you.	You have the power to fix it.
Why should Titania cross her Oberon?	Why would Titania want to argue with her Oberon?
I do but beg a little changeling boy, To be my henchman.	All I’m asking for is to have that little human boy as part of my crew.
Set your heart at rest.	Get over it.
The Fairyland buys not the child of me.	I won’t give up this child for all of Fairyland.
How long within this wood intend you stay?	How long do you plan to stay here in this forest?
Perchance till after Theseus' wedding day.	Maybe until after Theseus’s wedding day.
If you will patiently dance in our round And see our moonlight revels, go with us.	If you behave yourself and join us in our circle dance and moonlight celebrations, then you can come with us.
If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.	If not, leave me alone, and I’ll stay away from your turf.
Give me that boy and I will go with thee.	Give me that boy and I’ll come with you.
Not for thy fairy kingdom.—Fairies, away!	Not for your entire fairy kingdom.—Come, fairies, let’s go.
We shall chide downright, if I longer stay.	We’re going to have an out-and-out brawl if I stay any longer.
Well, go thy way.	Well, go on your way, then.
Thou shalt not from this grove Till I torment thee for this injury.— My gentle Puck, come hither.	You won’t leave this grove until I’ve paid you back for this insult.
I remember.	Yes, I remember.
That very time I saw (but thou couldst not) Flying between the cold moon and the Earth, Cupid all armed.	You couldn’t see him, but I could.
A certain aim he took At a fair vestal thronèd by the west, And loosed his love shaft smartly from his bow As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts.	He took aim at a beautiful young virgin who was sitting on a throne in the western part of the world, and he shot his arrow of love well enough to have pierced a hundred thousand hearts.
But I might see young Cupid’s fiery shaft Quenched in the chaste beams of the watery moon, And the imperial votaress passèd on, In maiden meditation, fancy-free.	But I could see that Cupid’s fiery arrow was put out by watery, virginal moonbeams, so the royal virgin continued her virginal thoughts without being interrupted by thoughts of love.
Yet marked I where the bolt of Cupid fell.	But I paid attention to where Cupid’s arrow fell.
It fell upon a little western flower, Before milk-white, now purple with love’s wound.	It fell on a little western flower, which used to be white as milk but now has turned purple from being wounded by the arrow of love.
And maidens call it “love-in-idleness.” Fetch me that flower.	Young girls call it “love-in-idleness.” Bring me that flower.
The herb I showed thee once.	I showed it to you once.
The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid Will make or man or woman madly dote Upon the next live creature that it sees.	If its juice is put on someone’s eyelids while they’re asleep, that person will fall in love with the next living creature he or she sees.
Fetch me this herb, and be thou here again Ere the leviathan can swim a league.	Bring me this plant, and get back here before the sea monster has time to swim three miles.
I’ll put a girdle round about the Earth In forty minutes.	I could go around the world in forty minutes.
Having once this juice, I’ll watch Titania when she is asleep And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.	When I have the juice of that flower, I’ll trickle some drops of it on Titania’s eyes while she’s sleeping.
The next thing then she waking looks upon— Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull, On meddling monkey or on busy ape— She shall pursue it with the soul of love.	She’ll fall madly in love with the first thing she sees when she wakes up—even if it’s a lion, a bear, a wolf, a bull, a monkey, or an ape.
And ere I take this charm from of her sight— As I can take it with another herb— I’ll make her render up her page to me.	And before I make her normal again—I can cure her by treating her with another plant—I’ll make her give me that little boy as my page.
But who comes here?	But who’s that coming this way?
I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.	Look, I don’t love you, so stop following me around.
Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?	Where are Lysander and beautiful Hermia?
The one I’ll stay, the other stayeth me.	Lysander I want to stop, but Hermia stops my heart from beating.
Thou told’st me they were stol'n unto this wood.	You told me they escaped into this forest.
And here am I, and wood within this wood, Because I cannot meet my Hermia.	And here I am, going crazy in the middle of the woods because I can’t find my Hermia.
Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.	Go away, get out of here, and stop following me.
You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant.	You attract me to you, you cruel magnet!
But yet you draw not iron, for my heart Is true as steel.	But you must not attract iron, because my heart is as true as steel.
Leave you your power to draw, And I shall have no power to follow you.	If you let go of your power to attract me, I won’t have any power to follow you.
Do I entice you?	Do I ask you to follow me?
Do I speak you fair?	Do I speak to you kindly?
Or rather, do I not in plainest truth Tell you I do not, nor I cannot, love you?	Don’t I tell you in the clearest terms that I do not and cannot love you?
And even for that do I love you the more.	Yes, but that makes me love you even more.
I am your spaniel.	I’m your little dog, Demetrius.
And, Demetrius, The more you beat me, I will fawn on you.	The more you beat me, the more I’ll love you.
Use me but as your spaniel—spurn me, strike me, Neglect me, lose me.	Treat me like you would treat a dog—kick me, hit me, neglect me, try to lose me.
Only give me leave, Unworthy as I am, to follow you.	Just let me follow behind you, even though I’m not good enough for you.
For I am sick when I do look on thee.	Just looking at you makes me sick.
And I am sick when I look not on you.	And I get sick when I can’t look at you.
Your virtue is my privilege.	I rely on your virtue to protect me.
Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company, For you in my respect are all the world.	This forest doesn’t seem deserted when you’re here, because you are all the world to me.
Then how can it be said I am alone When all the world is here to look on me?	So how can anyone say I’m alone, when the whole world is here to look at me?
I’ll run from thee and hide me in the brakes, And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.	I’ll run away from you and hide in the bushes, and leave you to the mercy of wild animals.
The wildest hath not such a heart as you.	The wildest animal isn’t as cruel as you are.
Let me go.	Leave me alone.
Or if thou follow me, do not believe But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.	Or if you follow me, you’d better understand that I’ll do something bad to you in the forest.
Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field You do me mischief.	Yes, you already hurt me in the church, in the town, and in the fields.
Fie, Demetrius!	Shame on you, Demetrius!
Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex.	Your behavior is an insult to all women.
We cannot fight for love as men may do.	We cannot fight for love as men can.
I’ll follow thee and make a heaven of hell, To die upon the hand I love so well.	I’ll follow you and turn this hell I’m in into a kind of heaven.
Fare thee well, nymph.	Goodbye, nymph.
Ere he do leave this grove, Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love.	Before he leaves this part of the forest, you’ll change places: you’ll be the one running away, and he’ll be in love with you.
Hast thou the flower there?	Do you have the flower?
Welcome, wanderer.	Welcome, traveler.
Ay, there it is.	Yes, here it is.
I pray thee, give it me.	Please, give it to me.
Thanks, good Egeus.	Thanks, good Egeus.
What’s the news with thee?	What’s new with you?
Full of vexation come I with complaint Against my child, my daughter Hermia.— Stand forth, Demetrius.—My noble lord, This man hath my consent to marry her.— Stand forth, Lysander.—And my gracious duke, This man hath bewitched the bosom of my child.— Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes, And interchanged love tokens with my child.	I’m here, full of anger, to complain about my daughter Hermia.—Step forward, Demetrius.—My lord, this man, Demetrius, has my permission to marry her.—Step forward, Lysander.—But this other man, Lysander, has cast a magic spell over my child’s heart.—You, you, Lysander, you’ve given her poems, and exchanged tokens of love with my daughter.
Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung With feigning voice verses of feigning love, And stol'n the impression of her fantasy With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gauds, conceits, Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats—messengers Of strong prevailment in unhardened youth.	You’ve pretended to be in love with her, singing fake love songs softly at her window by moonlight, and you’ve captured her imagination by giving her locks of your hair, rings, toys, trinkets, knickknacks, little presents, flowers, and candies—things that can really influence an impressionable young person.
With cunning hast thou filched my daughter’s heart, Turned her obedience (which is due to me) To stubborn harshness.—And, my gracious duke, Be it so she will not here before your grace Consent to marry with Demetrius, I beg the ancient privilege of Athens.	You’ve connived to steal my daughter’s heart, making her stubborn and harsh instead of obedient (like she should be).—And, my gracious duke, if she won’t agree to marry Demetrius right now, I ask you to let me exercise the right that all fathers have in Athens.
As she is mine, I may dispose of her— Which shall be either to this gentleman Or to her death—according to our law Immediately provided in that case.	Since she belongs to me, I can do what I want with her—as the law says: I can either make her marry Demetrius—or have her killed.
What say you, Hermia?	What do you have to say for yourself, Hermia?
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.	Demetrius is an admirable man.
There sleeps Titania sometime of the night, Lulled in these flowers with dances and delight.	Titania sleeps there sometimes at night, lulled to sleep among the flowers by dances and other delights.
And there the snake throws her enameled skin, Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in.	Snakes shed their skin there, and the shed skin is wide enough to wrap a fairy in.
And with the juice of this I’ll streak her eyes And make her full of hateful fantasies.	I’ll put the juice of this flower on Titania’s eyes, and fill her with horrible delusions and desires.
Fear not, my lord.	Don’t worry, sir.
Your servant shall do so.	I’m at your service.
Hence, away!	Okay, let’s go!
Now all is well.	Everything’s fine now.
One aloof stand sentinel.	One of us will stay and stand guard.
What thou seest when thou dost wake, Do it for thy true love take.	Whatever you see first when you wake up, think of it as your true love.
Wake when some vile thing is near.	Wake up when something nasty is nearby.
Be it so, Lysander.	Let’s do that, Lysander.
Find you out a bed, For I upon this bank will rest my head.	I’m going to rest my head on this little slope.
One heart, one bed, two bosoms, and one troth.	We’ll have one heart, one bed, two bodies, and one faithful vow.
Nay, good Lysander.	No, Lysander.
Do not lie so near.	Don’t sleep so close to me.
I mean that my heart unto yours is knit So that but one heart we can make of it.	I just meant that our hearts are joined, so we can almost think of them as one heart.
Then by your side no bed room me deny.	So let me sleep next to you.
And, good night, sweet friend.	Stay away for now, and good night, my sweet friend.
Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end!	I hope your love for me remains this strong for your entire life!
Amen, amen to that fair prayer, say I.	Amen to that.
Here is my bed.	I’ll sleep over here.
Pretty soul!	Stop, Demetrius!
Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius.	Stop, even if only to kill me.
I charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me thus.	I’m telling you, get out of here, and don’t follow me around like this.
O, wilt thou darkling leave me?	Oh, will you leave me alone in the dark?
Do not so.	Don’t.
Stay, on thy peril.	Stay here at your own risk.
I alone will go.	I’m going on alone.
Oh, I am out of breath in this fond chase.	Oh, I’m out of breath from this foolish chase.
The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.	The more I pray, the less I get out of it.
Happy is Hermia, wheresoe'er she lies, For she hath blessèd and attractive eyes.	Hermia is lucky, wherever she is, because she has beautiful eyes.
How came her eyes so bright?	How did her eyes get so bright?
Not with salt tears.	Not from crying.
If so, my eyes are oftener washed than hers.	If that’s the case, tears wash my eyes more than hers.
No, no, I am as ugly as a bear, For beasts that meet me run away for fear.	No, no, I’m as ugly as a bear, since animals that see me run away in terror.
Therefore no marvel though Demetrius Do, as a monster, fly my presence thus.	So it’s no surprise that Demetrius runs away from me as if I were a monster.
What wicked and dissembling glass of mine Made me compare with Hermia’s sphery eyne?	What evil and deceitful mirror made me think I could rival Hermia’s starry eyes?
Do not say so, Lysander.	Don’t say that, Lysander.
Say not so.	Don’t say that.
What though he love your Hermia?	Why do you care that he loves Hermia?
Lord, what though?	What does it matter?
Content with Hermia?	Happy with Hermia?
No.	No.
I do repent The tedious minutes I with her have spent.	I regret all the boring time I wasted with her.
Not Hermia but Helena I love.	I don’t love Hermia; I love Helena.
Things growing are not ripe until their season.	Fruits and vegetables don’t ripen until the right season of the year.
So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason.	Likewise, I’m young, and my sense of reason has just ripened.
Is ’t not enough, is ’t not enough, young man, That I did never, no, nor never can, Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye, But you must flout my insufficiency?	Is it not enough, is it not enough, young man, that I’ll never be pretty enough to get a kind look from Demetrius?
Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do, In such disdainful manner me to woo.	Do you have to harp on my inadequacy?
But fare you well.	But goodbye.
Perforce I must confess I thought you lord of more true gentleness.	I have to tell you, I thought you were a much kinder person than this.
Oh, that a lady of one man refused Should of another therefore be abused!	Oh, how awful that a lady who’s been rejected by one man should therefore be treated horribly by another one!
Are we all met?	Are we all here?
Pat, pat.	Right on time.
And here’s a marvelous convenient place for our rehearsal.	This is the perfect place to rehearse.
This green plot shall be our stage, this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house, and we will do it in action as we will do it before the duke.	This clearing will be the stage, and this hawthorn bush will be our dressing room.
Peter Quince— What sayest thou, bully Bottom?	Peter Quince— What is it, jolly Bottom?
There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe that will never please.	There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe that will never work.
First, Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself, which the ladies cannot abide.	First of all, Pyramus has to take out a sword to kill himself, which the ladies in the audience won’t be able to stand.
How answer you that?	What should we do about that?
I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.	I think we’ll have to leave out all the killing, come to think of it.
Not a whit.	Not at all!
I have a device to make all well.	I’ve got a plan that will fix everything.
Write me a prologue, and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords, and that Pyramus is not killed indeed.	I’ll tell them that we won’t hurt anyone with our swords, and that Pyramus isn’t really dead.
And for the more better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver.	And to make it even clearer, we can tell them that I’m playing Pyramus but I’m not really Pyramus—really, I’m Bottom the weaver.
This will put them out of fear.	That’ll keep them from being afraid.
Well.	All right, we’ll have a prologue then.
We will have such a prologue, and it shall be written in eight and six.	We’ll write it in alternating eight- and six-syllable lines, just like in a ballad.
No, make it two more.	No, add a couple more syllables.
Let it be written in eight and eight.	Make it eight and eight.
Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?	Won’t the ladies be scared of the lion?
I fear it, I promise you.	I’m really worried about that.
For there is not a more fearful wildfowl than your lion living.	There’s no scarier wild bird than the living lion, and we should remember that.
Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.	So we need another prologue to tell everyone he’s not a real lion.
Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must be seen through the lion’s neck.	No, we can just announce the actor’s name, and let his face show through the lion costume, and have him say something himself.
For, you know, Pyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight.	Because, you know, Pyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight.
So is Lysander.	So is Lysander.
In himself he is.	You’re right, Lysander’s admirable too.
But in this kind, wanting your father’s voice, The other must be held the worthier.	But since your father doesn’t want him to marry you, you have to consider Demetrius to be the better man.
I would my father looked but with my eyes.	I wish my father could see them with my eyes.
Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.	No, you must see them as your father sees them.
I do entreat your grace to pardon me.	Your grace, please forgive me.
I know not by what power I am made bold Nor how it may concern my modesty In such a presence here to plead my thoughts, But I beseech your grace that I may know The worst that may befall me in this case, If I refuse to wed Demetrius.	But please, tell me the worst thing that could happen to me if I refuse to marry Demetrius.
Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires.	So think carefully about what you want, beautiful Hermia.
Know of your youth.	Consider how young you are, and question your feelings.
Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?	Will the moon be shining on the night we’re performing our play?
A calendar, a calendar!	We need a calendar!
Look in the almanac.	Look in the almanac.
Find out moonshine, find out moonshine!	Look up moonshine, look up moonshine!
What say you, Bottom?	What do you think, Bottom?
And let him hold his fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisbe whisper.	He can hold his fingers in a V-shape like this, and Pyramus and Thisbe can whisper to each other through that little crack.
If that may be then all is well.	If we can do that, everything will be all right.
Come, sit down, every mother’s son, and rehearse your parts.—Pyramus, you begin.	Now sit down, everybody, and rehearse your parts—Pyramus, you start.
When you have spoken your speech, enter into that brake.—And so everyone according to his cue.	When you have said your lines, go hide in that bush.—Everyone else, go there too when you’re not onstage.
Speak, Pyramus.—Thisbe, stand forth.	Speak, Pyramus.—Thisbe, come forward.
Ay, marry, must you.	Yes, you are.
For you must understand he goes but to see a noise that he heard, and is to come again.	You’re supposed to show that you understand that Pyramus just went to check on a noise he heard and is coming right back.
Ninus' tomb,” man.	That’s “Ninus’s grave,” man.
Why, you must not speak that yet.	And don’t say all of that yet.
You speak all your part at once, cues and all.—Pyramus, enter.	You just said all your lines at once, cues and all.—Pyramus, enter.
It is “never tire.” Oh.	It’s “never get tired.” Oh!
Oh, monstrous!	Help!
Oh, strange!	It’s a monster!
We are haunted.	We’re being haunted.
Fly, masters!	Run, everyone, run!
I’ll follow you.	I’ll follow you.
Sometime a horse I’ll be, sometime a hound, A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire.	Sometimes I’ll turn into fire!
And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn, Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.	And I’ll neigh like a horse and bark like a hound and grunt like a pig and roar like a bear and burn like a fire at every turn.
Why do they run away?	Why are they running away?
O Bottom, thou art changed!	Oh, Bottom, you’ve changed!
What do I see on thee?	What have you got on your head?
What do you see?	What do you think I’ve got on my head?
You see an ass head of your own, do you?	You’re acting like an ass, don’t you think?
Bless thee, Bottom, bless thee.	God bless you, Bottom, God bless you.
Thou art translated.	Reborn.
But I will not stir from this place, do what they can.	But I won’t leave this spot, no matter what they do.
I will walk up and down here and I will sing, that they shall hear I am not afraid.	I’ll walk up and down and sing a song, so they’ll know I’m not afraid.
For indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish a bird?	Who’d waste his time talking to such a stupid bird?
Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason for that.	I don’t think you’ve got much of a reason to love me.
And yet, to say the truth, reason and love keep little company together nowadays.	But to tell you the truth, reason and love have very little to do with each other these days.
The more the pity that some honest neighbors will not make them friends.	It’s too bad some mutual friend of theirs doesn’t introduce them.
Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.	You’re as wise as you are beautiful.
Not so, neither.	No, that’s not true.
But if I had wit enough to get out of this wood, I have enough to serve mine own turn.	But if I were smart enough to get out of this forest, I’d be wise enough to satisfy myself.
I am a spirit of no common rate.	I’m no ordinary fairy.
Therefore go with me.	So come with me.
And I will purge thy mortal grossness so That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.— Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Moth, and Mustardseed!	And I’ll turn you into a spirit like us, so you won’t die as humans do.—Come here, Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Moth, and Mustardseed!
Ready.	Ready.
And I.	Me too.
And I.	Me too.
And I.	And me too.
Where shall we go?	Where should we go?
Be kind and courteous to this gentleman.	Be kind and polite to this gentleman.
Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes.	Leap and dance for him.
Feed him with apricoks and dewberries, With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries.	Feed him apricots and blackberries, with purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries.
And pluck the wings from painted butterflies To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes.	Pluck off colorful butterfly wings, and use them to fan moonbeams away from his eyes as he sleeps.
Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.	Bow to him, fairies, and curtsy to him.
Hail, mortal.	Hello, mortal!
Hail.	Hello!
Hail.	Hello!
Hail.	Hello!
I cry your worships' mercy, heartily.—I beseech your worship’s name.	I beg your pardon, sirs.—Please tell me your name, sir?
Cobweb.	Cobweb.
I shall desire you of more acquaintance, good Master Cobweb.	I’d like to get to know you better, Mr. Cobweb.
If I cut my finger, I shall make bold with you.— Your name, honest gentleman?	If I cut my finger, I’ll use you as a bandage to stop the bleeding.—And your name, sir?
Peaseblossom.	Peaseblossom.
I pray you, commend me to Mistress Squash, your mother, and to Master Peascod, your father.	Please, give my regards to your mother, Mrs. Peapod, and your father, Mr. Peapod.
Good Master Peaseblossom, I shall desire you of more acquaintance too.— Your name, I beseech you, sir?	Good Mr. Peaseblossom, I’d like to get to know you better too.—And you, may I ask what your name is, sir?
Mustardseed.	Mustardseed.
Good Master Mustardseed, I know your patience well.	Good Mr. Mustardseed, I know you very well.
That same cowardly, giantlike ox-beef hath devoured many a gentleman of your house.	Those cowardly, gigantic sides of beef have been responsible for many of your family members getting eaten as a condiment on beef.
I promise you your kindred hath made my eyes water ere now.	I swear to you, many members of your mustard family have made my eyes water before.
I desire you of more acquaintance, good Master Mustardseed.	I look forward to getting to know you better, Mr. Mustardseed.
Come, wait upon him.	Take good care of him.
Lead him to my bower.	Take him to my sleeping area.
The moon methinks looks with a watery eye.	The moon looks sad to me.
And when she weeps, weeps every little flower, Lamenting some enforcèd chastity.	When she cries, all the little flowers cry too.
Tie up my love’s tongue.	Keep my lover quiet.
Bring him silently.	Bring him to me in silence.
Here comes my messenger.—How now, mad spirit?	Ah, here comes my messenger.—What’s going on, you crazy spirit?
What night-rule now about this haunted grove?	What havoc have you wreaked in this part of the forest?
My mistress with a monster is in love.	My mistress Titania is in love with a monster.
I led them on in this distracted fear And left sweet Pyramus translated there.	I led them on in this frightened, distracted state, and left sweet
When in that moment so it came to pass, Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.	At that exact moment, Titania woke up and immediately fell in love with him, an ass.
This falls out better than I could devise.	This is going even better than I planned.
But hast thou yet latched the Athenian’s eyes With the love juice, as I did bid thee do?	But have you put the love juice from the flower on the eyes of that Athenian, as I asked you to do?
I took him sleeping—that is finished too— And the Athenian woman by his side, That, when he waked, of force she must be eyed.	Yes, I found him when he was asleep—so that’s taken care of too—and the Athenian woman was sleeping near him.
Oh, why rebuke you him that loves you so?	Why are you so rude to someone who loves you so much?
Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.	Save that kind of harsh language for your worst enemy.
If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep, Being o'er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep, And kill me too.	If you killed Lysander while he was sleeping, then you’re already up to your ankles in blood.
The sun was not so true unto the day As he to me.	He was more faithful to me than the sun is to the daytime.
Would he have stolen away From sleeping Hermia?	Would he have snuck away from me while I was asleep?
It cannot be but thou hast murdered him.	The only possibility is that you’ve murdered him.
So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim.	A murderer should look like you do, so pale and grim.
So should the murdered look, and so should I, Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty.	That’s how someone who’s been murdered should look, and that’s how I look.
Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear, As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.	You’ve pierced me through the heart with your cruelty, and yet you, the murderer, look as bright and clear as a star in the sky.
What’s this to my Lysander?	What does that have to do with my Lysander?
Where is he?	Where is he?
Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?	Oh, good Demetrius, will you find him for me?
Hast thou slain him then?	Did you kill him, then?
O brave touch!	Oh, how brave of you!
Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?	A snake could do that as easily as you could.
An adder did it, for with doubler tongue Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.	A snake did do it, because no snake ever had a more forked, lying tongue than you have.
I am not guilty of Lysander’s blood.	I didn’t kill Lysander.
Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.	As far as I know, he’s not even dead.
I pray thee, tell me then that he is well.	Then please tell me he’s all right.
An if I could, what should I get therefore?	If I told you that, what would I get out of it?
Relent, sweet Hermia—And, Lysander, yield Thy crazèd title to my certain right.	Please give in, sweet Hermia.—And Lysander, stop acting like she’s yours.
You have her father’s love, Demetrius.	Her father loves you, Demetrius.
And she is mine, and all my right of her I do estate unto Demetrius.	She’s mine, and I’m giving her to Demetrius.
A privilege never to see me more.	The privilege of never seeing me again.
And from thy hated presence part I so.	And now I’m going to leave your despised company.
See me no more, whether he be dead or no.	You’ll never see me again, whether or not he’s dead.
Here therefore for a while I will remain.	So I’ll stay here for a while.
And laid the love juice on some true love’s sight.	That’s the way of the world.
About the wood go swifter than the wind, And Helena of Athens look thou find— All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer, With sighs of love, that costs the fresh blood dear.	Go around the forest, moving faster than the wind, and make sure you find Helena of Athens.—She’s lovesick, and her face is pale from all the sighing she’s been doing, because sighing is bad for the blood.
Flower of this purple dye, Hit with Cupid’s archery, Sink in apple of his eye.	You purple flower, hit by Cupid’s arrow, sink into the pupils of this man’s eyes.
When thou wakest, if she be by, Beg of her for remedy.	Young man, when you wake up, if she’s nearby, beg her to cure your lovesickness.
Shall we their fond pageant see?	Should we watch this ridiculous scene?
Lord, what fools these mortals be!	Lord, what fools these mortals are!
Stand aside.	Step aside.
The noise they make Will cause Demetrius to awake.	The noise they’re making will wake up Demetrius.
Then will two at once woo one.	Then the two of them will both pursue one girl.
Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?	Why do you think I’m making fun of you when I tell you I love you?
Look, when I vow, I weep.	People don’t cry when they’re mocking someone.
How can these things in me seem scorn to you, Bearing the badge of faith to prove them true?	How can it seem like I’m making fun of you, when my tears prove that I’m sincere?
You do advance your cunning more and more.	You get trickier and trickier.
Will you give her o'er?	Will you abandon her?
Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.	Demetrius loves her, and he doesn’t love you.
Crystal is muddy.	Damn it!
I see you all are bent To set against me for your merriment.	I see you’re all determined to gang up on me for a few laughs.
You are unkind, Demetrius.	You’re competing for
Be not so.	Don’t be cruel, Demetrius.
And yours of Helena to me bequeath, Whom I do love and will do till my death.	In exchange, give up your claim to love Helena, since I love her and will love her until I die.
Lysander, keep thy Hermia.	Lysander, keep your Hermia.
I will none.	I don’t want her.
Helen, it is not so.	Helena, it’s not true.
Look, where thy love comes.	Look, here comes the woman you love.
Dark night, that from the eye his function takes, The ear more quick of apprehension makes.	It’s hard to see clearly in the dark of night, but it’s easier to hear well.
Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found.	I couldn’t see you, Lysander, but I heard your voice, and that’s how I found you.
Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?	Why did you leave me alone so unkindly?
Why should he stay, whom love doth press to go?	Why stay when love tells you to go?
What love could press Lysander from my side?	But what love could make my Lysander leave me?
Lysander’s love, that would not let him bide, Fair Helena, who more engilds the night Than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light.	I had to hurry to my love, beautiful Helena, who lights up the night better than all those fiery stars.
Why seek’st thou me?	Why are you looking for me?
Could not this make thee know The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so?	Didn’t you figure out that I left you because I hate you?
You speak not as you think.	You can’t mean what you’re saying.
It cannot be.	It’s impossible.
Lo, she is one of this confederacy!	So, she’s in on this too!
Now I perceive they have conjoined all three To fashion this false sport, in spite of me.— Injurious Hermia!	Now I see that all three of them have gotten together to play this cruel trick on me.
Is all the counsel that we two have shared, The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent When we have chid the hasty-footed time For parting us—oh, is it all forgot?	Have you forgotten all the talks we’ve had together, the vows we made to be like sisters to one another, all the hours we spent together, wishing that we never had to say goodbye—have you forgotten?
All schooldays' friendship, childhood innocence?	Our friendship in our schooldays, our childhood innocence?
We, Hermia, like two artificial gods, Have with our needles created both one flower, Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion, Both warbling of one song, both in one key, As if our hands, our sides, voices, and minds, Had been incorporate.	We used to sit together and sew one flower with our two needles, sewing it on one piece of cloth, sitting on the same cushion, singing one song in the same key, as if our hands, our sides, our voices and our minds were stuck together.
So we grew together, Like to a double cherry—seeming parted But yet an union in partition— Two lovely berries molded on one stem;	We grew together like twin cherries—which seemed to be separate but were also together—two lovely cherries on one stem.
Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes, Misprizing what they look on, and her wit Values itself so highly that to her All matter else seems weak.	There is scorn and disdain in her eyes, and those sparkling eyes despise everything they look upon.
She cannot love Nor take no shape nor project of affection She is so self-endeared.	She can’t even imagine what “love” is.
Sure, I think so, And therefore certainly it were not good She knew his love, lest she make sport at it.	It would be bad if she knew about Benedick’s love and teased him about it.
Why, you speak truth.	It’s true.
So turns she every man the wrong side out And never gives to truth and virtue that Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.	And so she turns men inside out and never acknowledges the integrity and merit that a man has.
But who dare tell her so?	But who would dare tell her?
If I should speak, She would mock me into air.	If I said something, she’d mock me so mercilessly that I’d probably disintegrate into air.
O, she would laugh me Out of myself, press me to death with wit.	She’d laugh me right out of my body and kill me with her wit.
Therefore let Benedick, like covered fire, Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly.	Like a fire that gets covered up, Benedick should smother his love and waste away.
It were a better death than die with mocks, Which is as bad as die with tickling.	It would be better to die that way than to die from being mocked, which is as bad as being killed by tickling.
No, rather I will go to Benedick And counsel him to fight against his passion; And truly I’ll devise some honest slanders To stain my cousin with.	No, instead I’ll go to Benedick and advise him to fight his emotions.
One doth not know How much an ill word may empoison liking.	You don’t know how quickly affection can be killed with a single nasty word.
O, do not do your cousin such a wrong!	Oh, don’t injure your cousin like that!
She cannot be so much without true judgment, Having so swift and excellent a wit As she is prized to have, as to refuse So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.	With the quick, intelligent wit she’s rumored to have, she can’t really be such a bad judge of character that she’d refuse a man as exceptional as Signior Benedick.
He is the only man of Italy, Always excepted my dear Claudio.	He’s the only worthy man in Italy, aside from my dear Claudio.
Indeed, he hath an excellent good name.	True, he has an excellent reputation.
His excellence did earn it, ere he had it.	And he deserves it, having been excellent before he had a reputation for it.
When are you married, madam?	When are you getting married, madam?
Why, every day, tomorrow.	Tomorrow, and then every day after that.
Come, go in.	Come on, let’s go inside.
I do but stay till your marriage be consummate, and then go I toward Aragon.	I’ll stay in Messina until you’re married, and then I’ll go to Aragon.
I’ll bring you thither, my lord, if you’ll vouchsafe me.	I’ll go with you, my lord, if you’ll allow me.
Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it.	No, taking you away from your new marriage would be like showing a child a new coat and then not letting him wear it.
I will only be bold with Benedick for his company, for from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth.	I’ll ask only Benedick to come with me, for from the top of his head to the soles of his feet he’s a joker.
He hath twice or thrice cut Cupid’s bow-string, and the little hangman dare not shoot at him.	He’s evaded love once or twice, and since then Cupid doesn’t dare to shoot at him.
He hath a heart as sound as a bell, and his tongue is the clapper, for what his heart thinks, his tongue speaks.	Benedick’s heart is like a bell, with his tongue as the clapper: everything his heart thinks, his tongue speaks.
Gallants, I am not as I have been.	Gentleman, I am not the same man I was before.
So say I. Methinks you are sadder.	I agree.
I hope he be in love.	I hope he’s in love.
There’s no true drop of blood in him to be truly touched with love.	There isn’t a single drop of sincerity in him that could be touched with love.
If he be sad, he wants money.	If he looks serious, he must need money.
What, sigh for the toothache?	What, are you moaning on about your toothache?
Yet say I, he is in love.	I repeat, he’s in love.
Unless he have a fancy to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.	Unless you’re talking about his love for this kind of foolishness—which, judging from his appearance, he has—he is no fool for love, as you pretend.
If he be not in love with some woman, there is no believing old signs.	If he’s not in love with a woman, then you can’t trust the usual symptoms.
He brushes his hat o' mornings.	He brushes his hat in the mornings.
What should that bode?	What do you think that means?
Hath any man seen him at the barber’s?	Has any man seen him at the barber’s?
No, but the barber’s man hath been seen with him, and the old ornament of his cheek hath already stuffed tennis balls.	No, but the barber’s assistant has been seen with him.
Nay, he rubs himself with civet.	And he’s rubbed himself with perfume.
Can you smell him out by that?	Can you smell out his secret now?
You embrace your charge too willingly.	But when  You take up your duties too cheerfully.
Her mother hath many times told me so.	That’s what her mother always tells me.
You have it full, Benedick.	Ah, he got you back, Benedick!
Truly, the lady fathers herself.—Be happy, lady, for you are like an honorable father.	Congratulations, lady: you resemble a most honorable man.
If Signor Leonato be her father, she would not have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as like him as she is.	Well, even if he is her father, I’m sure she wouldn’t want to have the head of the old man on her shoulders!
I wonder that you will still be talking, Signor Benedick.	I’m amazed you’re still talking, Signior Benedick.
Nobody marks you.	No one’s listening to you.
What, my dear Lady Disdain!	Look, it’s my dear Lady Disdain!
Are you yet living?	Aren’t you dead yet?
That’s as much as to say, the sweet youth’s in love.	That’s as good as proof that the sweet young man’s in love.
The greatest note of it is his melancholy.	The biggest clue is his seriousness.
And when was he wont to wash his face?	And when has he ever been known to wash his face?
Yea, or to paint himself?	Yes, or to wear cosmetics?
For the which I hear what they say of him.	I hear what they say about him for doing that.
Nay, but his jesting spirit, which is now crept into a lute string and now governed by stops— Indeed, that tells a heavy tale for him.	Indeed, his mocking spirit has now crawled into a  Truly, it all adds up to a serious story for Benedick.
Conclude, conclude, he is in love.	A conclusion, a conclusion: he is in love.
Nay, but I know who loves him.	Oh, and I know who loves him.
She shall be buried with her face upwards.	She’ll be buried with her face upwards, then.
Yet is this no charm for the toothache.—Old Signior, walk aside with me.	This chatter is no cure for my toothache.
Tis even so.	It must be.
My lord and brother, God save you.	My lord and brother, God save you.
Good e'en, brother.	Good evening, brother.
If your leisure served, I would speak with you.	If you don’t mind, I’d like to speak with you.
In private?	In private?
If it please you.	If you wish.
Yet Count Claudio may hear, for what I would speak of concerns him.	But Count Claudio can stay, for what I’m about to say concerns him.
What’s the matter?	What’s the matter?
You know he does.	You know that he does.
I know not that, when he knows what I know.	I don’t know that, once he knows what I know.
If there be any impediment, I pray you discover it.	If there’s any reason we shouldn’t get married, I urge you to tell me.
You may think I love you not.	You may think that I don’t love you.
Let that appear hereafter, and aim better at me by that I now will manifest.	I hope that, after I tell you my news, you will think better of me.
For my brother, I think he holds you well, and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect your ensuing marriage—surely suit ill spent and labor ill bestowed.	My brother thinks highly of you, and because of his affection, has helped arrange your marriage—but that was definitely a waste of his time and energy.
Why, what’s the matter?	Why, what’s the matter?
I came hither to tell you; and, circumstances shortened, for she has been too long a-talking of, the lady is disloyal.	I came here to tell you—I’ll make this short, since she’s already been talked about for too long—the lady is unfaithful.
Who, Hero?	Who, Hero?
Even she: Leonato’s Hero, your Hero, every man’s Hero.	That’s the one: Leonato’s Hero, your Hero, every man’s Hero.
Disloyal?	Unfaithful?
The word is too good to paint out her wickedness.	The word is too good to represent her wickedness.
I could say she were worse.	She is worse than wicked.
Think you of a worse title, and I will fit her to it.	If you can think of a more awful title, I’ll call her that.
Wonder not till further warrant.	But don’t keep wondering without more proof.
Go but with me tonight, you shall see her chamber window entered, even the night before her wedding day.	Come with me tonight, and you’ll see a man enter her bedroom chamber—even tonight, the night before her wedding.
If you love her then, tomorrow wed her.	If you still love her after that, then marry her tomorrow.
But it would better fit your honor to change your mind.	But you would be more honorable if you changed your mind.
I will not think it.	I won’t consider it.
If I see anything tonight why I should not marry her, tomorrow in the congregation, where I should wed, there will I shame her.	If I see anything tonight that convinces me not to marry her, I’ll shame her tomorrow in the very congregation where I would have married her.
And as I wooed for thee to obtain her, I will join with thee to disgrace her.	And since I wooed her in your name, I’ll join you in disgracing her.
Bear it coldly but till midnight and let the issue show itself.	Remain calm until midnight, and then you’ll see what the trouble is.
O day untowardly turned!	Oh, this day has turned into a disaster!
O mischief strangely thwarting!	Oh, mischief has ruined our plans!
O plague right well prevented!	Oh, a plague has been prevented, thank God!
So will you say when you have seen the sequel.	That’s what you’ll say once you’ve seen part two.
Are you good men and true?	Are you all good and honest men?
Come hither, neighbor Seacole.	Come here, Sir Seacole.
God hath blessed you with a good name.	God has blessed you with a good name.
To be a well-favored man is the gift of fortune, but to write and read comes by nature.	To be good-looking is a matter of luck, but to read and write is a natural gift.
Both which, Master Constable— You have.	Both of which, master constable— You have.
I knew it would be your answer.	I knew that would be your answer.
Well, for your favor, sir, why, give God thanks, and make no boast of it, and for your writing and reading, let that appear when there is no need of such vanity.	Well, for your good looks, sir, thank God and don’t boast about it.
You are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch; therefore bear you the lantern.	You’re thought to be the most
How if he will not stand?	you will  And what if he won’t stop?
Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go and presently call the rest of the watch together and thank God you are rid of a knave.	Then immediately call the rest of the watch together and thank God that you’ve gotten rid of such a criminal.
If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none of the Prince’s subjects.	If he won’t stop when he’s told to, then he isn’t one of the Prince’s subjects.
We know what belongs to a watch.	We know what’s appropriate for a watch.
Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman, for I cannot see how sleeping should offend.	Why, you speak like an experienced and quiet watchman.
Well, you are to call at all the alehouses and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.	Also, you’re supposed to visit all the bars and tell anyone who’s drunk to go home and go to bed.
How if they will not?	And what if they won’t go?
Why, then, let them alone till they are sober.	Well then, leave them alone until they’re sober.
If they make you not then the better answer, you may say they are not the men you took them for.	If even then they don’t answer to your satisfaction, you can say that they’re not the men you thought they were.
Well, sir.	Very good, sir.
If we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay hands on him?	So if we know that a man is a thief, should we try to arrest him?
You, constable, are to present the Prince’s own person.	You, constable, are representing the Prince himself.
If you meet the Prince in the night, you may stay him.	If you meet the Prince in the night, you can order him to stop.
Nay, by 'r Lady, that I think he cannot.	No, by our Lady, I don’t think he can.
Five shillings to one on ’t, with any man that knows the statutes, he may stay him—marry, not without the Prince be willing, for indeed the watch ought to offend no man, and it is an offense to stay a man against his will.	I’ll bet any man who knows the law five shillings to one on it.
By 'r lady, I think it be so.	By our Lady, I think that’s true.
An there be any matter of weight chances, call up me.	And if anything important happens, find me and let me know.
Well, masters, we hear our charge.	Well gentlemen, we’ve heard our assignment.
Let us go sit here upon the church bench till two, and then all to bed.	Let’s sit here on the church bench until two and then go off to bed.
One word more, honest neighbors.	One more thing, good gentlemen.
I pray you watch about Signior Leonato’s door, for the wedding being there tomorrow, there is a great coil tonight.	Watch over Signior Leonato’s house; with the wedding being held there tomorrow, there’s a great to-do there tonight.
Adieu, be vigitant, I beseech you.	Adieu.
What Conrade!	Be  Conrade!
Conrade, I say!	Conrade, I say!
Mass, and my elbow itched, I thought there would a scab follow.	Come to think of it, I thought I felt a scab there.
I will owe thee an answer for that.	I’ll get you for that.
And now forward with thy tale.	Now get on with your story.
Stand thee close, then, under this penthouse, for it drizzles rain, and I will, like a true drunkard, utter all to thee.	Since it’s drizzling, stand under this overhang with me and, like a true drunk, I’ll tell you everything.
Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats.	You should know I’ve earned a thousand gold pieces from Don John.
Is it possible that any villainy should be so dear?	Is it possible that any crime could be so valuable?
Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villainy should be so rich.	You should ask instead if it’s possible that any criminal could be so rich.
For when rich villains have need of poor ones, poor ones may make what price they will.	Because when rich villains need poor villains' services, those poor ones can name the price.
I wonder at it.	I can’t believe it.
That shows thou art unconfirmed.	That only proves how inexperienced you are.
Thou knowest that the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, is nothing to a man.	You know that the style of a man’s jacket or hat or coat means nothing.
Yes, it is apparel.	Yes, it’s just clothing.
Yes, the fashion is the fashion.	Yes, fashion is fashion.
Tush, I may as well say the fool’s the fool.	C’mon, I might as well say the fool’s the fool!
Didst thou not hear somebody?	But don’t you see what a    Did you hear someone?
No, ’twas the vane on the house.	Just the weathervane moving.
But art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion?	But you’re all wound up about fashion, too.
Not so, neither.	No, I’m not wound up.
But know that I have tonight wooed Margaret, the Lady Hero’s gentlewoman, by the name of Hero.	But I will tell you that I seduced Margaret, the Lady Hero’s waiting woman, tonight.
I should first tell thee how the Prince, Claudio and my master, planted and placed and possessed by my master Don John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter.	I should backtrack and begin with how my master, Don John, arranged for the Prince, Claudio, and himself to witness this friendly encounter from the orchard.
Then is courtesy a turncoat.	That makes Lady Courtesy a traitor.
But it is certain I am loved of all ladies, only you excepted.	All ladies love me, except you.
And I would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard heart, for truly I love none.	It’s too bad I’m so hard-hearted, because I really don’t love anyone.
A dear happiness to women.	Women are lucky, then.
They would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor.	You would make a nasty suitor.
I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me.	I would rather listen to my dog bark at a crow than hear a man swear that he loves me.
God keep your Ladyship still in that mind, so some gentle- man or other shall ’scape a predestinate scratched face.	Well, I hope you stay in that frame of mind or some poor man will end up with his face all scratched up.
Scratching could not make it worse an ’twere such a face as yours were.	If he has a face like yours, a good scratching couldn’t make him look any worse.
Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.	Listen to you, instructing me like a parrot would.
A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.	I’d rather be a squawking bird than an animal like you.
I would my horse had the speed of your tongue and so good a continuer.	I wish my horse moved as fast as your mouth and was as tireless.
I have done.	That’s it—I’m done.
You always end with a jade’s trick.	You always slip out of the argument like this.
I know you of old.	I know you from before.
That is the sum of all, Leonato.—Signior Claudio and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all.	And that’s everything, Leonato.—Claudio, Benedick—my dear friend Leonato has invited you all to stay here at Messina.
I tell him we shall stay here at the least a month, and he heartily prays some occasion may detain us longer.	I told him we’ll stay for at least a month, and he says that he hopes we’ll stay longer.
I dare swear he is no hypocrite but prays from his heart.	I think he’s actually serious, and not just being polite.
And thought they Margaret was Hero?	And they thought Margaret was Hero?
We charge you, in the Prince’s name, stand!	We charge you, in the Prince’s name, to stop!
Call up the right Master Constable.	Call up the Master Constable Dogberry.
We have here recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that ever was known in the commonwealth.	We have  And one of them is the criminal Deformed.
And one Deformed is one of them.	I know him; he wears a lock of hair.
I know him; he wears a lock.	Gentlemen, gentlemen—   Gentlemen, don’t speak.
Masters, masters—   warrant you.	We
Masters, never speak, we charge you, let us obey you go with us.	We’re probably a very valuable catch for these guys.
A commodity in question, I warrant you.—Come, we’ll obey you.	Let’s go, we’ll obey you.
Good Ursula, wake my cousin Beatrice and desire her to rise.	Good Ursula, go wake my cousin and ask her to get up.
I will, lady.	I will, lady.
And bid her come hither.	And request that she come here.
Well.	Very well.
Troth, I think your other rebato were better.	Really, I think your other ruff is better.
No, pray thee, good Meg, I’ll wear this.	No, please good Meg, I’ll wear this one.
By my troth, ’s not so good, and I warrant your cousin will say so.	Honestly, it’s not as good as the other one, and I’m sure your cousin will agree with me.
My cousin’s a fool, and thou art another.	My cousin’s a fool, and you are too.
I’ll wear none but this.	I’ll wear this one and none other.
I like the new tire within excellently, if the hair were a thought browner; and your gown’s a most rare fashion, i' faith.	I like your new wig and headdress, though I’d like it more if the hair were a shade browner.
I saw the Duchess of Milan’s gown that they praise so.	You know, I saw the Duchess of Milan’s gown, the one that everyone praises so highly.
Oh, that exceeds, they say.	Oh, they say that dress surpasses all others.
But for a fine, quaint, graceful, and excellent fashion, yours is worth ten on ’t.	But for a fine, elegant, graceful, and excellent dress, yours is worth ten of those.
God give me joy to wear it, for my heart is exceeding heavy.	I hope I enjoy wearing it, for my heart is very heavy.
Twill be heavier soon by the weight of a man.	It will be made even heavier soon—by the weight of a man.
Of what, lady?	Shame of what, lady?
Is not marriage honorable in a beggar?	Sex and marriage are honorable things—even for a beggar, right?
Is not your lord honorable without marriage?	And isn’t your husband an honorable man?
Good morrow, sweet Hero.	Good morning, sweet Hero.
Why, how now?	Why do you sound so odd?
Do you speak in the sick tune?	Are you ill?
I am out of all other tune, methinks.	You sound out of tune.
Do you sing it, and I’ll dance it.	You sing, and I’ll dance.
O illegitimate construction!	Never!
These gloves the Count sent me, they are an excellent perfume.	The Count sent me an excellent pair of perfumed gloves.
I am stuffed, cousin.	Sorry, I’m all stuffed.
Even since you left it.	Ever since you lost yours.
Doth not my wit become me rarely?	Doesn’t my wit suit me well?
It is not seen enough; you should wear it in your cap.	It doesn’t get seen enough; you should wear it in your cap, the way fools wear coxcombs.
By my troth, I am sick.	God, I’m really sick.
I meant plain holy thistle.	I just meant that you should use some holy thistle.
You may think perchance that I think you are in love.	Maybe you think that I think you’re in love.
Nay, by 'r Lady, I am not such a fool to think what I list, nor I list not to think what I can, nor indeed I cannot think, if I would think my heart out of thinking, that you are in love or that you will be in love or that you can be in love.	No, by Our Lady, I’m not such a fool to think what I please, and I don’t please to think what I can, and in fact I cannot think, even if I could think my heart right past thinking, that you are in love or that you will be in love or even that you can be in love.
Yet Benedick was such another, and now is he become a man.	But Benedick was once an enemy of love as well, and now he’s become a real man.
He swore he would never marry, and yet now, in despite of his heart, he eats his meat without grudging.	He swore that he’d never get married, but now, despite his earlier protestations, he loves ungrudgingly.
And how you may be converted I know not, but methinks you look with your eyes as other women do.	And yet I think you look with your eyes just like every other woman does.
Not a false gallop.	It’s not a false gallop, anyway.
Madam, withdraw: the Prince, the Count, Signor Benedick, Don John, and all the gallants of the town are come to fetch you to church.	Madam, we have to go: the Prince, the Count, Signior Benedick, Don John, and all the gentlemen of the town have come to bring you to church.
Help to dress me, good coz, good Meg, good Ursula.	Good cousin, good Meg, good Ursula, come help me get dressed.
What would you with me, honest neighbor?	What do you want from me, my good man?
Marry, this it is, sir.	Indeed, sir, it is.
Yes, in truth it is, sir.	Yes, it truly is.
What is it, my good friends?	What’s the news, my good friends?
Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the matter.	Sorry, sir, Goodman Verges tends to ramble.
It pleases your Worship to say so, but we are the poor duke’s officers.	Thank you for saying that, your Worship, but we’re just the poor duke’s officers.
But truly, for mine own part, if I were as tedious as a king, I could find it in my heart to bestow it all of your worship.	But truly, if I were as
All thy tediousness on me, ah?	Oh, so you’d give me all your tediousness?
Yea, an ’twere a thousand pound more than ’tis, for I hear as good exclamation on your Worship as of any man in the city, and though I be but a poor man, I am glad to hear it.	Yes, even if I had a thousand more pounds than that, for I hear that you are  Me, too.
Gifts that God gives.	God gives those gifts—I had nothing to do with it.
I must leave you.	Now I must return to the wedding.
One word, sir.	One more thing, sir.
Take their examination yourself and bring it me.	Examine them yourselves, then bring me your findings.
I am now in great haste, as it may appear unto you.	Now I’m in a great hurry, as I’m sure you can see.
Fare you well.	Goodbye.
My lord, they stay for you to give your daughter to her husband.	My lord, they’re waiting for you to give your daughter away to Claudio.
I am ready.	I’m coming.
Go, good partner, go, get you to Francis Seacole.	Go to Francis Seacole, the constable of the watch.
Bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the jail.	Tell him to bring his pen and his inkwell to the jail.
We will spare for no wit, I warrant you.	We won’t hold back any of our wisdom.
Here’s that shall drive some of them to a noncome.	We’ll drive them to a
If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn.	I am being serious, my lord.
I thank you.	Thank you.
I am not of many words, but I thank you.	I’m not a man who talks a lot, but I thank you.
Please it your Grace lead on?	If it pleases you, your highness, will you lead us all inside?
Your hand, Leonato.	Give me your hand, Leonato.
We will go together.	We will go in together.
Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?	Benedick, did you notice Signior Leonato’s daughter?
I noted her not, but I looked on her.	I saw her, but I didn’t notice her.
Is she not a modest young lady?	Isn’t she a well-mannered young lady?
Do you question me as an honest man should do, for my simple true judgment?	Do you want my true opinion?
Or would you have me speak after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?	Or do you want me to criticize her like I do all women?
No, I pray thee speak in sober judgment.	No, please, speak seriously.
Why, i' faith, methinks she’s too low for a high praise, too brown for a fair praise, and too little for a great praise.	Well, it seems to me that she is too short to be praised highly, too dark to be praised fairly, and too small to be praised greatly.
Only this commendation I can afford her, that were she other than she is, she were unhandsome, and being no other but as she is, I do not like her.	I can only say this about her: if she looked different than she does, she would be ugly, and since she can’t be anything but herself, I don’t like her.
Thou thinkest I am in sport.	You think I’m kidding.
I pray thee tell me truly how thou lik’st her.	Please tell me seriously what you think of her.
Come, Friar Francis, be brief, only to the plain form of marriage, and you shall recount their particular duties afterwards.	All right, Friar Francis, let’s keep this short.
No.	No.
Lady, you come hither to be married to this count?	No, he comes to be married  Lady, do you come here to be married to this count?
I do.	I do.
If either of you know any inward impediment why you should not be conjoined, charge you on your souls to utter it.	If either of you knows any secret reason why you two should not be joined in marriage, I order you on your souls to say so.
Know you any, Hero?	Do you know any, Hero?
None, my lord.	None, my lord.
Know you any, count?	Do you know any, count?
I dare make his answer, none.	I’m sure I can answer for him—he doesn’t know any, either.
O, what men dare do!	Oh, the things men dare to do!
What men may do!	The things men are allowed to do!
What men daily do, not knowing what they do!	The things men do daily, not knowing what they’re doing!
How now, interjections?	What, are we playing with interjections?
Why, then, some be of laughing, as, ah, ha, he!	Well then, add some interjections that indicate laughter, like  Hold on, Friar.
As freely, son, as God did give her me.	As freely, son, as God gave her to me.
And what have I to give you back whose worth May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?	And what should I give you that would be equal in value to this rare and precious gift?
Nothing, unless you render her again.	Nothing, sir, except grandchildren.
Sweet Prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.— There, Leonato, take her back again.	There, Leonato, take your daughter back.
She’s but the sign and semblance of her honor.	She only appears honorable from the outside.
Behold how like a maid she blushes here!	Look, how she blushes like a virgin!
Oh, what authority and show of truth Can cunning sin cover itself withal!	Oh, sin can disguise itself so artfully!
Comes not that blood as modest evidence To witness simple virtue?	Doesn’t that rising blush suggest that she is virtuous and innocent?
Would you not swear, All you that see her, that she were a maid By these exterior shows?	All of you who are looking at her, wouldn’t you swear that she’s a virgin, judging by these outward shows?
But she is none.	But she is no virgin.
She knows the heat of a luxurious bed.	She has been in a man’s bed.
Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.	She blushes from guilt, not modesty.
What do you mean, my lord?	What do you mean, my lord?
Dear my lord, if you in your own proof Have vanquished the resistance of her youth And made defeat of her virginity— I know what you would say: if I have known her, You will say she did embrace me as a husband, And so extenuate the forehand sin.	My dear lord, if it was you who conquered her and took her virginity— I know what you’re about to say.
And seemed I ever otherwise to you?	And have I ever seemed less than modest or appropriate to you?
Out on thee, seeming!	Curse you for your false appearances!
Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?	Is that why you’re talking so wildly?
Sweet Prince, why speak not you?	Good Prince, say something!
What should I speak?	What should I say?
I stand dishonored, that have gone about To link my dear friend to a common stale.	I’ve been dishonored: I arranged for a friend of mine to marry a common whore.
Are these things spoken, or do I but dream?	Are you really saying these things, or am I dreaming?
Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.	They’re really being spoken, sir, and they’re true.
This looks not like a nuptial.	This doesn’t look like a wedding.
True!	It’s true!
O God!	Oh God!
Leonato, stand I here?	Leonato, am I standing here?
Is this the Prince?	Is this the Prince?
Is this the Prince’s brother?	Is this the Prince’s brother?
Is this face Hero’s?	Is this face Hero’s?
Are our eyes our own?	Are these our eyes?
All this is so, but what of this, my lord?	Yes, that’s all true—but what do you mean by it, my lord?
Let me but move one question to your daughter, And by that fatherly and kindly power That you have in her, bid her answer truly.	Let me just ask her one question, and by your authority as her father, order her to answer truthfully.
I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.	As my child, I order you to do so.
Oh, God defend me!	Oh, God help me!
how am I beset!— What kind of catechizing call you this?	What kind of game is this?
To make you answer truly to your name.	We just want you to answer to your real name.
Is it not Hero?	Isn’t my name Hero?
Who can blot that name With any just reproach?	Who can stain that name with a just accusation?
Marry, that can Hero!	Indeed, Hero herself can!
Hero itself can blot out Hero’s virtue.	You’ve stained your virtue with your own actions.
What man was he talked with you yesternight Out at your window betwixt twelve and one?	What man were you talking to at your window last night, between the hours of midnight and one?
Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.	If you’re a virgin, you’ll answer this question.
I talked with no man at that hour, my lord.	I wasn’t talking to any man at that time, my lord.
Upon mine honor, Myself, my brother, and this grievèd count Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night Talk with a ruffian at her chamber window Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain, Confessed the vile encounters they have had A thousand times in secret.	I swear on my honor that we saw and heard Hero talking to a brute at her window last night.
There is not chastity enough in language, Without offense, to utter them.—Thus, pretty lady, I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.	Pretty lady, I’m much ashamed of your shocking behavior.
Why, how now, cousin!	What’s wrong, cousin?
wherefore sink you down?	Why have you collapsed?
Come, let us go.	Come, let’s go.
These things, come thus to light, Smother her spirits up.	These revelations have overwhelmed her.
How doth the lady?	How is she?
Dead, I think.—Help, uncle!— Hero, why, Hero!	She’s dead, I think.—Help, uncle!—Hero, why Hero!
Uncle!	Uncle!
Signor Benedick!	Signior Benedick!
Friar!	Friar!
Death is the fairest cover for her shame That may be wished for.	Death is the best way to cover over her shame.
How now, cousin Hero!	How are you, Hero?
Yea, wherefore should she not?	Yes, why shouldn’t she?
Wherefore!	Why not!
Why, doth not every earthly thing Cry shame upon her?	Isn’t every living thing condemning her?
Grieved I I had but one?	Am I sorry that I only had one child?
Chid I for that at frugal Nature’s frame?	Do I blame Nature for being so thrifty?
O, one too much by thee!	Oh, one child is one too many!
Why had I one?	Why did I ever have one?
Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?	Why did you once seem lovely to me?
Why had I not with charitable hand Took up a beggar’s issue at my gates, Who, smirchèd thus, and mired with infamy, I might have said, “No part of it is mine; This shame derives itself from unknown loins”?	Why didn’t I just adopt a beggar’s child left at my doorstep, whose shame and dishonor I could have denied, not being its true father?
Sir, sir, be patient.	Sir, sir, calm down.
For my part, I am so attired in wonder I know not what to say.	I’m so amazed by this, I don’t know what to say.
Oh, on my soul, my cousin is belied!	Oh, on my soul, my cousin has been slandered falsely!
Lady, were you her bedfellow last night?	Lady, did you sleep in her room last night?
No, truly not, although until last night I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow.	No, I didn’t, but I did every night for the past year.
Confirmed, confirmed!	Then it’s confirmed!
I have marked A thousand blushing apparitions To start into her face, a thousand innocent shames In angel whiteness beat away those blushes, And in her eye there hath appeared a fire To burn the errors that these princes hold Against her maiden truth.	And in her eyes I see a fire that would seem to burn away the lies the princes have told about her chastity.
Friar, it cannot be.	But she must be, Friar.
Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left Is that she will not add to her damnation A sin of perjury.	You see that any morals she has left are preventing her from denying the charges: she doesn’t want to add perjury to her list of sins.
There is some strange misprision in the princes.	The princes are under some strange misunderstanding.
Two of them have the very bent of honor, And if their wisdoms be misled in this, The practice of it lives in John the Bastard, Whose spirits toil in frame of villainies.	Two of them are completely honorable, and if they have been tricked in this, we must blame John the Bastard, who lives to create conflict.
I know not.	I don’t know.
If they speak but truth of her, These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honor, The proudest of them shall well hear of it.	If they have spoken the truth about Hero, I will tear her apart with my bare hands.
Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine Nor age so eat up my invention Nor fortune made such havoc of my means Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends But they shall find, awaked in such a kind, Both strength of limb and policy of mind, Ability in means and choice of friends, To quit me of them throughly.	Age hasn’t dried up my body or eroded my intelligence so much, and luck hasn’t robbed me of so much of my fortune, and my bad ways haven’t deprived me of so many friends, that they won’t find me ready to seek revenge both physically and mentally, with money and friends at my disposal.
Pause awhile, And let my counsel sway you in this case.	Hold on a moment, and listen to my advice.
Your daughter here the princes left for dead.	The princes left your daughter here for dead.
Let her awhile be secretly kept in And publish it that she is dead indeed.	Hide her for a while in your house, and tell everyone that she has, in fact, died.
Maintain a mourning ostentation, And on your family’s old monument Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites That appertain unto a burial.	Make a bug show of mourning for her, hang sad epitaphs up at your family’s tomb, and perform all the appropriate burial ceremonies.
What shall become of this?	Why should we do this?
What will this do?	What will this do?
That is some good.	That will be a good thing.
She, dying, as it must so be maintained, Upon the instant that she was accused, Shall be lamented, pitied and excused Of every hearer.	We’ll maintain that she died the instant she was accused, and everyone who hears this will grieve for her, pity her, and excuse her actions.
So will it fare with Claudio.	That’s how Claudio will respond.
But if all aim but this be leveled false, The supposition of the lady’s death Will quench the wonder of her infamy.	And even if they don’t, at least Hero’s supposed death will stop the rumors of her infidelity.
And if it sort not well, you may conceal her, As best befits her wounded reputation, In some reclusive and religious life, Out of all eyes, tongues, minds, and injuries.	And if it doesn’t go well, then you can keep her hidden in a nunnery, the best place for someone with her kind of dirtied reputation—away from the public’s eyes, tongues, mind, and insults.
Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you.	Signior Leonato, listen to the friar’s plan.
And though you know my inwardness and love Is very much unto the Prince and Claudio, Yet, by mine honor, I will deal in this As secretly and justly as your soul Should with your body.	And even though you know I’m very close to the Prince and Claudio, I swear I’ll keep your counsel and deal with this secretly and justly.
Would you buy her, that you enquire after her?	Are you thinking of buying her?
But speak you this with a sad brow?	But tell me, are you speaking seriously?
Or do you play the flouting jack, to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a rare carpenter?	Or are you just teasing?
Come, in what key shall a man take you to go in the song?	If I’m going to sing along with you, I need to know what key you’re singing in.
In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I looked on.	I think she’s the most wonderful woman I’ve ever laid eyes on.
I can see yet without spectacles, and I see no such matter.	I’m still young enough to see without glasses, and I don’t see what you’re talking about.
But I hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?	But, hey, this doesn’t mean you’re looking to get married, does it?
I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the contrary, if Hero would be my wife.	Even if I had sworn never to marry, I wouldn’t trust myself to keep that promise if Hero would marry me.
Is ’t come to this?	What’s going on these days?
In faith, hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion?	Isn’t there one man left in the world who knows not to take a wife?
Look, Don Pedro is returned to seek you.	Look, Don Pedro has come back for you.
Tis well consented.	This is a good agreement.
Presently away, For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure.— Come, lady, die to live.	Come, lady; you must die in order to live.
This wedding day Perhaps is but prolonged.	Hopefully, your wedding day is only postponed.
Have patience and endure.	Have patience and endure.
Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?	Lady Beatrice, have you been crying this entire time?
Yea, and I will weep a while longer.	Yes, and I’ll keep crying a while longer.
I will not desire that.	I don’t wish that on you.
Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged.	I really believe your cousin was falsely accused.
Ah, how much might the man deserve of me that would right her!	Oh, the man who avenged her could ask anything of me!
Is there any way to show such friendship?	Is there any way I could show such friendship to you?
A very even way, but no such friend.	A very clear way, but there is no friend who will undertake it.
May a man do it?	Can a man do it?
It is a man’s office, but not yours.	It’s a job meant for a man, but not you.
I do love nothing in the world so well as you.	There is nothing in the world that I love as much as you.
Is not that strange?	Isn’t that strange?
As strange as the thing I know not.	It’s as strange as this other thing which I don’t understand.
I am sorry for my cousin.	I feel awful for my cousin.
By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me.	By my sword, Beatrice, you love me.
With no sauce that can be devised to it.	Not with any sauce they could provide for them.
I protest I love thee.	I swear, I love you.
Why then, God forgive me.	Well then, God forgive me!
What offense, sweet Beatrice?	Why, what have you done, sweet Beatrice?
You have stayed me in a happy hour.	You got to me first.
I was about to protest I loved you.	I was about to swear that I loved you.
And do it with all thy heart.	Then do so, with all your heart.
I love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protest.	I love you with so much of my heart that none of it is left to protest with.
Come, bid me do anything for thee.	Come, ask me to do anything for you.
Kill Claudio.	Kill Claudio.
Ha!	Ha!
Not for the wide world.	I wouldn’t do that for the whole wide world.
You kill me to deny it.	Then, rejecting my request, you kill
Tarry, sweet Beatrice.	Wait, sweet Beatrice.
I am gone, though I am here.	My body waits here, but the rest of me is gone.
There is no love in you.	You don’t really love me.
Nay, I pray you let me go.	I beg you to let me go.
Beatrice— In faith, I will go.	Beatrice— I swear, I’m going.
We’ll be friends first.	Not until we part as friends.
You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy.	How dare you try to be my friend when you refuse to fight my enemy.
Is Claudio thine enemy?	Is Claudio your enemy?
Is he not approved in the height a villain, that hath slandered, scorned, dishonored my kinswoman?	Hasn’t he proven himself to be a great villain—slandering, scorning, and dishonoring my cousin?
Oh, that I were a man!	Oh, I wish I were a man!
What, bear her in hand until they come to take hands and then, with public accusation, uncovered slander, unmitigated rancor—O God, that I were a man!	He pretended that everything was fine until the moment they were exchanging vows, and then—with public accusation, blatant slander, pure hatred—Oh God, if only I were a man!
I would eat his heart in the marketplace.	I would rip his heart out in public and eat it.
Hear me, Beatrice— Talk with a man out at a window!	Listen to me, Beatrice— Talking with a man outside her bedroom window!
A proper saying!	A likely story!
Nay, but Beatrice— Sweet Hero, she is wronged, she is slandered, she is undone.	No, but Beatrice— Sweet Hero, she’s been wronged, she’s been slandered, she’s been ruined.
Beat—	Beat—
Princes and counties!	Princes and counts!
Surely, a princely testimony, a goodly count, Count Comfect, a sweet gallant, surely!	He’s a proper count, that Count Sugarplum, a sweet gentleman, for sure!
Oh, that I were a man for his sake!	Oh, if only I were a man!
Or that I had any friend would be a man for my sake!	Or had a friend who would be a man for me!
But manhood is melted into curtsies, valor into compliment, and men are only turned into tongue, and trim ones too.	All this conversing has turned men into tongues—and fancy ones, at that.
He is now as valiant as Hercules that only tells a lie and swears it.	The man who tells a lie and swears by it is now considered as brave as Hercules.
I cannot be a man with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with grieving.	I can’t make myself a man by wishing I were, so as a woman I’ll die, from grieving.
Tarry, good Beatrice.	Wait, good Beatrice.
By this hand, I love thee.	I swear by this hand that I love you.
Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it.	Don’t just swear by it; put your hand to some use that will prove you love me.
Enough, I am engaged.	That’s enough for me, then.
I will challenge him.	I’ll challenge him.
I will kiss your hand, and so I leave you.	I’ll kiss your hand, and with that I leave you.
By this hand, Claudio shall render me a dear account.	I swear that Claudio will pay dearly for this.
Go comfort your cousin.	Keep me in your thoughts and go comfort your cousin.
Which be the malefactors?	Which ones are the malefactors?
Marry, that am I and my partner.	Sir, that would be me and my partner.
Let them come before Master Constable.	Have them come in front of the master constable.
Yea, marry, let them come before me.	Yes, indeed, bring them before me.
What’s your name, friend?	What’s your name, friend?
Borachio.	Borachio.
Pray, write down, “Borachio.”—Yours, sirrah?	Please, write down “Borachio.”—And yours?
I am a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrade.	I’m a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrade.
Write down “Master Gentleman Conrade.”—Masters, do you serve God?	Write down “Master Gentleman Conrade.”—Gentlemen, are you good Christians, and do you serve God?
Yea, sir, we hope.	Yes, sir, we hope so.
How answer you for yourselves?	How do you both plead?
Marry, sir, we say we are none.	Honestly, sir, we say that we are not criminals.
A marvelous witty fellow, I assure you, but I will go about with him.—Come you hither, sirrah, a word in your ear.	He’s a marvelously witty fellow, no doubt, but I’ll outmaneuver him.—Come over here; I’ll whisper a word in your ear.
Sir, I say to you it is thought you are false knaves.	Sir, I tell you we believe you’re both lying criminals.
Sir, I say to you we are none.	Sir, I tell you that we are not.
Well, stand aside.—'Fore God, they are both in a ale.	Well, okay.—I swear to God, both their stories match.
Have you writ down that they are none?	Have you written that down, that they aren’t criminals?
Master Constable, you go not the way to examine.	Master Constable, you’re going about this all wrong.
You must call forth the watch that are their accusers.	First, you have to speak to the watchmen who accused them.
Yea, marry, that’s the eftest way.—Let the watch come forth.	Yes, good idea; that’s the
This man said, sir, that Don John, the Prince’s brother, was a villain.	This man said, sir, that Don John, the Prince’s brother, was a villain.
Write down Prince John a villain.	Write down that Prince John is a villain.
I do not like thy look, I promise thee.	I swear, I don’t like the look of you.
Marry, that he had received a thousand ducats of Don John for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully.	That Don John had given him a thousand pieces of gold for wrongfully accusing the Lady Hero.
Flat burglary as ever was committed.	That’s burglary, that is.
Yea, by Mass, that it is.	Yes, by God, that it is.
What else, fellow?	What else did you hear?
What else?	What else?
This is all.	That’s all.
Prince John is this morning secretly stolen away.	I’ll get there first and tell him what we found out.
God’s my life, where’s the Sexton?	Honest to God, where’s the sexton?
Let him write down the Prince’s officer “coxcomb.” Come, bind them.—Thou naughty varlet!	Come on, tie them up.
Away!	Get away from me, you ass!
You are an ass, you are an ass!	You ass!
Dost thou not suspect my place?	Don’t you suspect my office?
Dost thou not suspect my years?	Don’t you
If you go on thus, you will kill yourself, And ’tis not wisdom thus to second grief Against yourself.	If you keep on the way you’ve been going, you’ll kill yourself.
I pray thee, cease thy counsel, Which falls into mine ears as profitless As water in a sieve.	Stop advising me; your words pass through my ears like water through a sieve.
Bring me a father that so loved his child, Whose joy of her is overwhelmed like mine, And bid him speak of patience.	Find a father who loved his child as overwhelmingly as I loved Hero and ask
Therefore give me no counsel.	So don’t advise me.
I pray thee, peace.	Please, leave me alone.
I will be flesh and blood, For there was never yet philosopher That could endure the toothache patiently, However they have writ the style of gods And made a push at chance and sufferance.	I intend to be flesh and blood, not airy philosophy, for there has never yet been a philosopher who could endure a toothache patiently, even though they all write as if they had risen above human suffering and misfortune.
Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself.	But don’t take all that pain on yourself.
Make those that do offend you suffer too.	Make sure the ones who have wronged you suffer too.
There thou speak’st reason.	Now you’re talking.
Nay, I will do so.	I definitely will.
My soul doth tell me Hero is belied, And that shall Claudio know; so shall the Prince And all of them that thus dishonor her.	In my soul, I believe Hero has been falsely accused.
Here comes the Prince and Claudio hastily.	The Prince and Claudio are hurrying this way.
Good e'en, good e'en.	Good evening, good evening.
Good day to both of you.	Good day to both of you.
Hear you, my lords—     We have some haste, Leonato.	Listen, my lords— We’re in a bit of a hurry, Leonato.
I would your grace would constrain me to tell.	Your highness will have to force me to tell.
Amen, if you love her, for the lady is very well worthy.	It’s good if you love Hero, because she’s worthy of your love.
You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.	You’re trying to trick me, my lord.
By my troth, I speak my thought.	I swear, I’m telling you what I honestly think.
Some haste, my lord!	A bit of a hurry, my lord!
Well, fare you well, my lord.	Well then, good bye, my lord.
Are you so hasty now?	You’re in a hurry, are you?
Well, all is one.	Well then, don’t bother.
Nay, do not quarrel with us, good old man.	Come on, don’t quarrel with us, good old man.
If he could right himself with quarreling, Some of us would lie low.	If it’s fighting he is after, some of us here should run and hide.
Who wrongs him?	Who has wronged him?
Marry, thou dost wrong me, thou dissembler, thou.	Indeed, you have wronged me, you liar.
Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword.	Don’t bother trying to intimidate me by putting your hand on your sword.
I fear thee not.	I’m not scared of you.
Marry, beshrew my hand If it should give your age such cause of fear.	Curse my hand if it ever threatened an old man like you.
In faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword.	Really, I had no intention of going for my sword.
Tush, tush, man, never fleer and jest at me.	Damn you, don’t mock and sneer at me.
I speak not like a dotard nor a fool, As under privilege of age to brag What I have done being young, or what would do Were I not old.	I’m not a doddering old fool who brags about the things he did when he was young, and what he would do now if he weren’t so old.
Know, Claudio, to thy head, Thou hast so wronged mine innocent child and me That I am forced to lay my reverence by, And with gray hairs and bruise of many days Do challenge thee to trial of a man.	Claudio, I’m telling you right to your face that you have wronged me and my innocent child.
I say thou hast belied mine innocent child.	You have ruined my innocent child.
Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart, And she lies buried with her ancestors, Oh, in a tomb where never scandal slept Save this of hers, framed by thy villainy.	Your slander has broken her heart, and now she lies buried with her ancestors in a tomb—ancestors who had never been tainted by scandal until you caused one with your wickedness.
My villainy?	My wickedness?
Thine, Claudio, thine, I say.	Yours, Claudio, yours, I say.
You say not right, old man.	You’ve got it wrong, old man.
My lord, my lord, I’ll prove it on his body if he dare, Despite his nice fence and his active practice, His May of youth and bloom of lustihood.	I’ll beat him despite his fancy fencing techniques and all the practicing he does, despite his youth and manliness.
Away!	Not a chance!
I will not have to do with you.	I’ll have nothing to do with you.
Canst thou so daff me?	You think you can get rid of me that easily?
Thou hast killed my child.	You killed my child.
If thou kill’st me, boy, thou shalt kill a man.	Take on someone your own size: if you kill me, boy, you’ll have killed a man.
He shall kill two of us, and men indeed, But that’s no matter.	He’ll have to kill both of us, and indeed we’re both men.
Let him kill one first.	But let him start off easy by killing one of us.
Win me and wear me!	Come on—kill me and brag about it!
Let him answer me.— Come, follow me, boy.	Let me at him.
Sir boy, I’ll whip you from your foining fence, Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will.	I will, as surely as I am a gentleman.
Brother— Content yourself.	Brother— Quiet.
God knows I loved my niece, And she is dead, slandered to death by villains That dare as well answer a man indeed As I dare take a serpent by the tongue.— Boys, apes, braggarts, jacks, milksops!	God knows I loved my niece, and now she’s dead—slandered to death by cowards who would just as likely fight a real man as I would grab a poisonous snake by the tongue.
Brother Anthony—	Brother Anthony—
Hold you content.	Hold your peace.
But brother Anthony—     Come, ’tis no matter.	But brother Anthony— Don’t, it’s no big deal.
Do not you meddle.	Don’t bother with it.
Let me deal in this.	Let me deal with this.
Gentlemen both, we will not wake your patience.	Gentlemen, we won’t stay here and anger you further.
My heart is sorry for your daughter’s death, But, on my honor, she was charged with nothing But what was true and very full of proof.	I’m sorry about your daughter’s death, but I swear our accusations were true, and backed up with proof.
My lord, my lord— I will not hear you.	My lord, my lord— I don’t want to hear any more about it.
No?	No?
Come, brother; away!	Come on, brother!
I will be heard.	I’m determined to be heard by someone.
And shall, or some of us will smart for it.	And you will be, or some people here will suffer for it.
See, see, here comes the man we went to seek.	Look, here comes just the man we were looking for.
Now, Signior, what news?	What’s up, mister?
Welcome, Signior.	Welcome, sir.
You are almost come to part almost a fray.	You just missed a fight that was barely avoided.
We had like to have had our two noses snapped off with two old men without teeth.	We were about to have our noses snapped off by two old men with no teeth.
Leonato and his brother.	Leonato and his brother.
What think’st thou?	What do you think?
Had we fought, I doubt we should have been too young for them.	I think if we had fought, we would have proven too young and strong for them after all.
In a false quarrel there is no true valor.	There’s no bravery in an unfair fight.
As I am an honest man, he looks pale.—Art thou sick, or angry?	Look: Benedick is so pale—are you sick, or angry?
killed a cat?	Lighten up.
Thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care.	Sir, don’t even try to beat me in a battle of wits.
Sir, I shall meet your wit in the career, an you charge it against me.	I’ll meet all your attacks, even if you come charging at me with a lance at full gallop.
I pray you, choose another subject.	Choose another tack.
I think he be angry indeed.	I think he really is angry.
If he be, he knows how to turn his girdle.	If he is, that’s his problem.
Shall I speak a word in your ear?	Can I have a word with you privately?
God bless me from a challenge!	God forbid he wants to challenge me!
Do me right, or I will protest your cowardice.	lain.
You have killed a sweet lady, and her death shall fall heavy on you.	You’ve killed an innocent woman, and you’re going to pay dearly for her death.
Let me hear from you.	What do you say?
What, a feast, a feast?	What, are we having a feast?
I' faith, I thank him.	Yes, we are.
I’ll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit he other day.	Benedick, Beatrice praised your wit the other day.
I said thou hadst a fine wit.	I said you had a fine wit.
True,” said she, “a fine little one.” “No,” said I, “a great wit.” “Right,” says she, “a great gross one.” “Nay,” said I, “a good wit.” “Just,” said she, “it hurts nobody.” “Nay,” said I, “the gentleman is wise.” “Certain,” said she, “a wise gentleman.” “Nay,” said I, “he hath the tongues.” “That I believe,” said she, “for he swore a thing to me on Monday night, which he forswore on Tuesday morning; there’s a double tongue, there’s two tongues.” Thus did she an hour together transshape thy particular virtues.	True,” she said, “a fine little one.” “No,” I said, “a huge wit.” “Right,” she said, “a hugely awful one.” “No,” I said, “he has a good wit.” “Exactly,” she said, “it’s good and mild; it doesn’t hurt anyone.” “No,” I said, “Benedick is wise.” “He is certainly,” she said,  She cried a lot at that, and said she didn’t care.
Yea, that she did.	That she did.
But yet for all that, an if she did not hate him deadly, she would love him dearly.	And yet for all that, if she didn’t hate him to death, she’d love him to death.
The old man’s daughter told us all.	Leonato’s daughter had told us everything.
All, all.	Absolutely everything.
And, moreover, God saw him when he was hid in the garden.	And, moreover, God saw Benedick when he was hid in the garden.
But when shall we set the savage bull’s horns on the sensible Benedick’s head?	But when exactly will we see Benedick married?
Yea, and text underneath: “Here dwells Benedick the married man”?	Yes, with the sign underneath him that says: “Here lives Benedick the married man”?
Fare you well, boy.	Goodbye, boy.
You know my mind.	You know what I intend.
I will leave you now to your gossip-like humor.	I’ll leave you now to chatter and gossip like an old woman.
You break jests as braggarts do their blades, which, God be thanked, hurt not.—My lord, for your many courtesies I thank you.	The wit you flaunt is like a blunt sword—it can’t hurt anyone, thank God.—My lord, I thank you for your many kindnesses.
I must discontinue your company.	I’m leaving your court now.
Your brother the Bastard is fled from Messina.	Your brother Don John the Bastard has run away from Messina.
You have among you killed a sweet and innocent lady.	The three of you have killed a sweet, innocent woman.
For my Lord Lackbeard there, he and I shall meet, and till then peace be with him.	Lord Babyface over there will meet me in a duel, and good luck to him then.
He is in earnest.	He’s serious.
In most profound earnest, and, I’ll warrant you, for the love of Beatrice.	Very serious, and I’m sure it’s because of Beatrice.
And hath challenged thee?	And he challenged you to a duel?
Most sincerely.	He did, very sincerely.
What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his doublet and hose and leaves off his wit!	What a strange sight—a man who has put on all his fancy clothes but forgotten his brain at home!
He is then a giant to an ape; but then is an ape a doctor to such a man.	A guy like that is bigger than an ape, but the ape could be his doctor, it’s so much smarter.
But soft you, let me be.	But wait a minute.
Pluck up, my heart, and be sad.	Let me gather my wits and get serious here.
Did he not say my brother was fled?	Didn’t he say my brother has run away?
Come you, sir.	Come on, you.
If justice cannot tame you, she shall ne'er weigh more reasons in her balance.	If they let you off, then we’ll have to assume that Lady Justice has lost all her power.
Nay, an you be a cursing hypocrite once, you must be looked to.	Since you are a lying hypocrite, we must look after you.
How now?	What’s this?
Two of my brother’s men bound!	Two of my brother’s men, all tied up!
Officers, what offense have these men done?	Officers, what crime have these men committed?
Marry, sir, they have committed false report; moreover, they have spoken untruths; secondarily, they are slanders; sixth and lastly, they have belied a lady; thirdly, they have verified unjust things; and, to conclude, they are lying knaves.	Well sir, they’ve lied; moreover, they have said things that were not true; secondarily, they are slanderers; sixth and lastly, they have falsely accused a lady; thirdly, they have confirmed things that did not in fact happen; and, in conclusion, they are lying scoundrels.
First, I ask thee what they have done; thirdly, I ask thee what’s their offense; sixth and lastly, why they are committed; and, to conclude, what you lay to their charge.	First, I ask you what they’ve done; thirdly, I ask you what offense they’re charged with; sixth and lastly, I ask you why they’ve been committed here; and, in conclusion, I ask what they’re accused of.
I have deceived even your very eyes.	I tricked your own eyes.
My villainy they have upon record, which I had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my shame.	They’ve recorded my crimes, and I would rather die than have to retell this shameful story.
The lady is dead upon mine and my master’s false accusation.	The lady has died because of the false accusations of me and my master.
I have drunk poison whiles he uttered it.	His words are like poison to me.
Yea, and paid me richly for the practice of it.	Yes, and paid me well for doing it.
He is composed and framed of treachery, And fled he is upon this villainy.	He is made of treachery, and has run away to avoid his crimes.
Sweet Hero, now thy image doth appear In the rare semblance that I loved it first.	Sweet Hero; when I imagine you now, you seem as beautiful as you did when I first loved you.
Here, here comes Master Signior Leonato, and the Sexton too.	Come, take away the  Here comes Master Signior Leonato with the sexton.
Which is the villain?	Which one of them did it?
Let me see his eyes, That, when I note another man like him, I may avoid him.	Let me see what he looks like, so when I see another man who resembles him, I’ll know to avoid him.
Which of these is he?	Which one is it?
If you would know your wronger, look on me.	If you want to see your deceiver, then look at me.
Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast killed Mine innocent child?	Are you the slave who, with your slanderous words, killed my innocent child?
Yea, even I alone.	Yes, I am the one.
No, not so, villain, thou beliest thyself.	No, villain, but you didn’t work alone.
I know not how to pray your patience, Yet I must speak.	I don’t know how to ask you for forgiveness, but I have to say something.
Choose your revenge yourself.	Choose your revenge.
I cannot bid you bid my daughter live— That were impossible—but, I pray you both, Possess the people in Messina here How innocent she died.	I can’t ask you to make my daughter live—that’s impossible—but I beg you both to tell the people of Messina that she was innocent when she died.
And if your love Can labor ought in sad invention, Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb And sing it to her bones.	And if your love can produce something from its sadness, write a poem for her; hang it on her grave and sing it to her bones.
Sing it tonight.	Sing it tonight.
Tomorrow morning come you to my house, And since you could not be my son-in-law, Be yet my nephew.	Then come to my house tomorrow morning, and since you couldn’t be my son-in-law, be my nephew instead.
My brother hath a daughter, Almost the copy of my child that’s dead, And she alone is heir to both of us.	My brother has a daughter who looks exactly like Hero; this girl is heir to both our estates.
Give her the right you should have given her cousin, And so dies my revenge.	Marry her as you should have married her cousin, and I will let my revenge die.
That I love her, I feel.	And  I feel that I love her.
That she is worthy, I know.	I know that she is worthy of that love.
And never could maintain his part but in the force of his will.	Or in the power of reason.
That a woman conceived me, I thank her.	I was conceived by a woman, and I thank her very much for all her effort.
That she brought me up, I likewise give her most humble thanks.	And then she brought me up, and I thank her for that, too.
I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.	I swear, before I die I’m going to see you sick with love.
With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord, not with love.	With anger, with fever, or with hunger, sure, my friend, but never sick with love.
Prove that ever I lose more blood with love than I will get again with drinking, pick out mine eyes with a ballad-maker’s pen and hang me up at the door of a brothel house for the sign of blind Cupid.	If you can prove that I’ll ever be so in love that I can’t be brought to my senses with a good round of beers, you can pluck out my eyes with a love-poet’s pen and hang me on a brothel’s door where the picture of blind Cupid usually goes.
O noble sir!	Oh, noble sir!
Your overkindness doth wring tears from me.	Your overwhelming kindness makes me weep.
I do embrace your offer; and dispose For henceforth of poor Claudio.	I willingly accept your offer and put my future in your hands.
Tomorrow then I will expect your coming.	I will see you tomorrow, then.
Tonight I take my leave.	Now I have to leave.
This naughty man Shall face to face be brought to Margaret, Who I believe was packed in all this wrong, Hired to it by your brother.	This wicked man will be brought face to face with Margaret, who I believe was hired by Don John to take part in this plot.
I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.	Thank you for all your efforts.
Your worship speaks like a most thankful and reverent youth, and I praise God for you.	You speak like a very thankful and respectful boy, and may God bless you.
God save the foundation!	God save the charitable organization!
I leave an arrant knave with your Worship, which I beseech your Worship to correct yourself, for the example of others.	I leave a slimy bastard with you, your Worship, for you to punish and make an example of.
God keep your Worship!	God bless your Worship!
I wish your Worship well.	I wish you well.
God restore you to health!	I hope that God restores you to health.
Farewell, my lords.	Goodbye, gentlemen.
We look for you tomorrow.	We’ll see you tomorrow.
We will not fail.	We’ll be there.
Tonight I’ll mourn with Hero.	I will mourn Hero tonight.
Pray thee, sweet Mistress Margaret, deserve well at my hands by helping me to the speech of Beatrice.	Please Margaret, help me write this poem for Beatrice.
To have no man come over me!	You certainly deserve it.
A most manly wit, Margaret, it will not hurt a woman.	It’s just that my wit is very gentlemanly, Margaret, and refuses to hurt a woman.
And so, I pray thee, call Beatrice.	Now please, tell Beatrice to come out.
Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I think hath legs.	I’ll go get Beatrice for you, who can walk here by herself—she has legs.
And therefore will come.	So that means she’ll come.
I mean in singing.	I’m really a pitiful singer.
Sweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I called thee?	Take  Beatrice, have you come because I called for you?
Yea, Signior, and depart when you bid me.	Yes, sir, and I’ll leave when you ask me to.
Oh , stay but till then!	Oh, well, stay till then!
Only foul words, and thereupon I will kiss thee.	I spoke angry, foul words to him, and with that I will kiss you.
Foul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is but foul breath, and foul breath is noisome.	If you had foul words in your mouth, then your breath must be foul, and foul breath is nauseating.
Therefore I will depart unkissed.	Thus, I’ll leave without being kissed.
Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense, so forcible is thy wit.	Your wit is so forceful, it frightens the very meaning out of your words.
But I must tell thee plainly, Claudio undergoes my challenge, and either I must shortly hear from him, or I will subscribe him a coward.	But I will tell you this very plainly: I have challenged Claudio, and either he’ll accept the challenge or admit he’s a coward.
And I pray thee now tell me, for which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me?	Now, tell me—which of my bad qualities did you fall in love with first?
For them all together, which maintained so politic a state of evil that they will not admit any good part to intermingle with them.	With all of them at once: they work together to create such an entirely evil person that no good ever manages to enter the mix.
But for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me?	But tell me—which of my good qualities first made you suffer love for me?
Suffer love!	Suffer love!
A good epithet!	That’s a good way of putting it.
I do suffer love indeed, for I love thee against my will.	I do suffer love, because I love you against my will.
In spite of your heart, I think.	You love me in spite of your heart, I think.
If a man do not erect in this age his own tomb ere he dies, he shall live no longer in monument than the bell rings and the widow weeps.	In this day and age, if a man doesn’t erect his own monument before he dies, he won’t be remembered past the funeral bell’s ringing and his widow’s crying.
And how long is that, think you?	Exactly how long is that, do you think?
Question: why, an hour in clamor and a quarter in rheum.	About an hour for the ringing and fifteen minutes for the crying.
Therefore is it most expedient for the wise, if Don Worm, his conscience, find no impediment to the contrary, to be the trumpet of his own virtues, as I am to myself.	That’s why it’s better for wise men to trumpet their own virtues, like I do.
So much for praising myself, who, I myself will bear witness, is praiseworthy.	That’s why I praise myself, who—if I do say so myself—is quite praiseworthy.
An now tell me, how doth your cousin?	But tell me, how is your cousin?
Very ill, too.	I’m very sick, too.
Serve God, love me, and mend.	Have faith, love me, and you will get better.
Madam, you must come to your uncle.	Madam, you have to go to your uncle’s.
It is proved my Lady Hero hath been falsely accused, the Prince and Claudio mightily abused, and Don John is the author of all, who is fled and gone.	It’s been proven that Lady Hero is innocent, that the Prince and Claudio have been utterly deceived, and that Don John—who has run away—is the source of all the trouble.
Will you come presently?	Will you come immediately?
Will you go hear this news, Signior?	Will you come with me to hear this news, sir?
I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be buried in thy eyes—and moreover, I will go with thee to thy uncle’s.	I will live in your heart, die in your lap, and be buried in your eyes—and, what’s more, I will go with you to your uncle’s.
Is this the monument of Leonato?	Is this the family tomb of Leonato?
It is, my lord.	It is, my lord.
Done to death by slanderous tongues Was the Hero that here lies.	Here lies Hero, The heroic maiden killed by slanderous words.
Death, in guerdon of her wrongs, Gives her fame which never dies.	To repay her for her troubles, Death Gives her undying fame.
So the life that died with shame Lives in death with glorious fame.	So the life that died with shame Lives on with fame.
Hang thou there upon the tomb, Praising her when I am dumb.	This epitaph will hang here forever, Continuing to praise Hero after I die.
Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.	Now start the music, and sing the solemn hymn.
Now, unto thy bones good night!	Now I say good night to your bones, Hero.
Yearly will I do this rite.	I will perform this ceremony every year.
Good morrow, masters.	Good morning, gentlemen.
Put your torches out.	Put out your torches.
The wolves have preyed, and look, the gentle day, Before the wheels of Phoebus, round about Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey.	The wolves have finished preying for the night, and look—the gentle dawn is rising, dappling the sleepy eastern sky with spots of light.
Good morrow, masters.	Good morning, gentlemen.
Did I not tell you she was innocent?	Didn’t I tell you she was innocent?
So are the Prince and Claudio, who accused her Upon the error that you heard debated.	And the Prince and Claudio, who accused her, are innocent as well, because they were deceived by Don John.
Well, I am glad that all things sort so well.	Well, I’m glad that everything has been sorted out.
And so am I, being else by faith enforced To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it.	Me too—otherwise I would have had to duel with Claudio.
Well, daughter, and you gentlewomen all, Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves, And when I send for you, come hither masked.	When I send for you, come out wearing masks.
The Prince and Claudio promised by this hour To visit me.—You know your office, brother.	The Prince and Claudio are supposed to be here by now.—You know your job, brother.
You must be father to your brother’s daughter, And give her to young Claudio.	You have to pretend to be your niece’s father, and give her away to Claudio.
To do what, Signior?	What do you need me to do?
That eye my daughter lent her; ’tis most true.	She sees you with the eyes my daughter lent her, it’s true.
And I do with an eye of love requite her.	And I see her also through the eyes of love.
The sight whereof I think you had from me, From Claudio and the Prince.	And those eyes were endowed with sight by Claudio, the Prince, and me.
But what’s your will?	But what did you want?
Your answer, sir, is enigmatical.	Sir, I’m puzzled by what you just said.
And my help.	And I’ll help you.
Here comes the Prince and Claudio.	Here comes the Prince and Claudio.
Good morrow to this fair assembly.	Good morning to all these lovely people.
Good morrow, Prince; good morrow, Claudio.	Good morning, Prince; good morning, Claudio.
We here attend you.	We’re waiting here for you.
Are you yet determined Today to marry with my brother’s daughter?	Are you still set on marrying my brother’s daughter?
I’ll hold my mind were she an Ethiope.	I wouldn’t change my mind even if she were
Well, as time shall try.	Well, time will tell.
Well, you temporize with the hours.	Just you wait.
Commend me to him and tell him I will not fail him at supper, for indeed he hath made great preparation.	Give him my respects, and tell him I’ll definitely be there for dinner, since I know he has gone to great lengths for this meal.
Call her forth, brother.	Bring her out, brother.
Here’s the friar ready.	The friar’s ready.
Good morrow, Benedick.	Good morning, Benedick.
I think he thinks upon the savage bull.	I think he’s nervous—he’s about to become the savage bull who got domesticated.
Tush, fear not, man.	Oh, don’t worry about it—we’ll dip your    I’ll get you for that one.
Here comes other reck'nings.	But here are other matters to be dealt with.
Which is the lady I must seize upon?	Which is the lady I’m supposed to marry?
This same is she, and I do give you her.	This one, and I will give her to you.
No, that you shall not till you take her hand Before this friar and swear to marry her.	No, you can’t do that until you take her hand and, in front of this friar, swear to marry her.
Another Hero!	It’s another Hero!
Nothing certainer.	Exactly right.
One Hero died defiled, but I do live, And surely as I live, I am a maid.	And as surely as I am alive, I am a virgin.
The former Hero!	It’s the former Hero!
Hero that is dead!	The Hero that died!
She died, my lord, but whiles her slander lived.	She was only dead, my lord, as long as her slander lived.
All this amazement can I qualify When after that the holy rites are ended I’ll tell you largely of fair Hero’s death.	I can confirm that all these shocking things are true.
Soft and fair, Friar.—Which is Beatrice?	Which one of you is Beatrice?
Do not you love me?	Do you love me?
Why no, no more than reason.	No, no more than is reasonable.
Why then, your uncle and the Prince and Claudio Have been deceived.	Well then, your uncle and the Prince and Claudio have been deceived.
They swore you did.	They swore you did.
Do not you love me?	Do you love me?
Troth, no, no more than reason.	Truly, no—no more than is reasonable.
Why then, my cousin, Margaret, and Ursula Are much deceived, for they did swear you did.	Well then, Margaret, Ursula, and my cousin have been very much deceived, for they swore you did.
They swore that you were almost sick for me.	They swore that you were sick with love for me.
They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me.	They swore that you were nearly dead with love for me.
Tis no such matter.	Oh, well.
Then you do not love me?	So you don’t love me?
No, truly, but in friendly recompense.	No, I don’t—except as a friend.
Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman.	Come on, niece, I’m sure you love him.
And here’s another, Writ in my cousin’s hand, stol'n from her pocket, Containing her affection unto Benedick.	And here’s another poem, which I stole from my cousin’s pocket—in her handwriting and all about her adoration for Benedick.
A miracle!	What a miracle!
Here’s our own hands against our hearts.	Our handwriting gives away our hearts.
Come, I will have thee, but, by this light, I take thee for pity.	Come on, I’ll take you, but honestly I’m only doing it out of pity.
I would not deny you, but, by this good day, I yield upon great persuasion, and partly to save your life, for I was told you were in a consumption.	I won’t say no to you, but let it be known that I’m only doing this after a lot of persuasion and to save your life —I hear you were quickly wasting away without me.
Peace!	Oh, shut up!
I will stop your mouth.	I’ll stop your mouth with a kiss.
How dost thou, Benedick, the married man?	How does it feel to be Benedick the Married Man?
I’ll tell thee what, Prince: a college of wit-crackers cannot flout me out of my humor.	I’ll tell you what, Prince: a whole university full of wisecrackers couldn’t change my mood today.
Dost thou think I care for a satire or an epigram?	You think I care what I’m called?
No.	Well, I don’t.
First, of my word!	No, before!
Therefore play, music.—Prince, thou art sad.	Musicians, play us a song.—Prince, you look sad.
Get thee a wife, get thee a wife.	You should get a wife!
To the tuition of God.	Into God’s hands.
From my house, if I had it— The sixth of July.	From my house, if I had a house—” “The sixth of July.
My liege, your highness now may do me good.	Before you make  My lord, you could really help me out now.
My love is thine to teach.	I am at your service.
Teach it but how, And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn Any hard lesson that may do thee good.	Just tell me what you want me to do, and however hard it is, you’ll see that I’m eager to do it.
Hath Leonato any son, my lord?	Does Leonato have a son, my lord?
No child but Hero; she’s his only heir.	Hero is his only child, and his only heir.
Dost thou affect her, Claudio?	Do you like her, Claudio?
If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it, And I will break with her and with her father, And thou shalt have her.	Look, if you really love the beautiful Hero, enjoy it.
Was ’t not to this end That thou began’st to twist so fine a story?	Isn’t that the reason you told me all this?
But lest my liking might too sudden seem, I would have salved it with a longer treatise.	But I didn’t want you to think that I’m hasty in my emotions.
What need the bridge much broader than the flood?	That’s like building a bridge wider than the river it crosses.
I will assume thy part in some disguise And tell fair Hero I am Claudio, And in her bosom I’ll unclasp my heart And take her hearing prisoner with the force And strong encounter of my amorous tale.	I’ll disguise myself as you and pour out “my” feelings to Hero, taking her prisoner with the force of my love story.
In practice let us put it presently.	Let’s get started right away.
Hath he provided this music?	Has he taken care of the music?
He is very busy about it.	He is taking care of it as we speak.
But, brother, I can tell you strange news that you yet dreamt not of.	But brother, I have some strange news for you.
Are they good?	Is it good news?
Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?	Is this servant of yours a smart man?
A good sharp fellow.	He’s very bright.
I will send for him, and question him yourself.	I’ll get him to come here, and you can ask him yourself.
He is very near by this.	He must be very near by now.
He was not three leagues off when I left him.	When I left him, he was less than nine miles from here.
How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?	How many noblemen were killed in the battle you just fought?
But few of any sort, and none of name.	Not many, and no one important.
A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers.	A victory in battle is twice as victorious when all the soldiers return home safely.
I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed much honor on a young Florentine called Claudio.	Claudio deserves to be honored, and Don Pedro has rewarded him accordingly.
He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it.	He has an uncle here in Messina who will be glad to hear this news.
No, no, we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself.	No, no, until it comes true we’ll pretend it was just a dream we had.
But I will acquaint my daughter withal, that she may be the better prepared for an answer if peradventure this be true.	But my daughter should know about this, so she can be prepared with an answer just in case.
Go you and tell her of it.	Go to her and tell her for me.
Cousins, you know what you have to do.—O, I cry you mercy, friend.	Cousins, you all have work to do.—Oh, I beg your pardon.
Go you with me and I will use your skill.— Good cousin, have a care this busy time.	Come with me now, and help me out.
What the goodyear, my lord, why are you thus out of measure sad?	Really, my lord, why are you so excessively sad?
Therefore the sadness is without limit.	Therefore my sadness is without limit.
You should hear reason.	You should listen to reason.
I cannot hide what I am.	I can’t hide what I am.
Yea, but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment.	Sure, but don’t do it at full volume until there’s no danger in it.
You have of late stood out against your brother, and he hath ta'en you newly into his grace, where it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself.	Not long ago you challenged and opposed your brother, and it is only very recently that he has forgiven you.
It is needful that you frame the season for your own harvest.	You have to wait for the appropriate time to let loose.
I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace, and it better fits my blood to be disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any.	I’d rather be a weed in a hedge than a rose in my brother’s garden.
In this, though I cannot be said to be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied but I am a plain-dealing villain.	Though I am not a flattering, righteous man, at least you can say that I am honest about being a villain.
In the meantime, let me be that I am, and seek not to alter me.	Until that happens, let me be who I am and don’t try to change me.
Can you make no use of your discontent?	Can’t you somehow use your dissatisfaction to your own advantage?
I make all use of it, for I use it only.	I use it all the time, since it’s all that I have.
Who comes here?	Who’s that?
What news, Borachio?	What’s going on, Borachio?
What is he for a fool that betroths himself to unquietness?	Who is this fool who wants all the fuss of marriage?
Marry, it is your brother’s right hand.	Your brother’s right-hand man.
Who?	Who?
The most exquisite Claudio?	That pretty boy, Claudio?
Even he.	That’s the one.
Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.	Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.
A very forward March-chick!	A lively young one!
How came you to this?	How did you learn about this?
Being entertained for a perfumer, as I was smoking a musty room, comes me the Prince and Claudio, hand in hand, in sad conference.	As I was working on one musty room, the Prince and Claudio entered.
Come, come, let us thither.	Come, let’s go to the dance.
This may prove food to my displeasure.	This just may cheer me up.
If I can cross him any way, I bless myself every way.	If there’s any way I can spoil his life, I’ll be overjoyed.
You are both sure, and will assist me?	You’ll both help me, right?
To the death, my lord.	Until the day we die, my lord.
Let us to the great supper.	Let’s go to this great feast.
We’ll wait upon your lordship.	Lead the way, sir.
Was not Count John here at supper?	Wasn’t Don John at dinner tonight?
I saw him not.	I didn’t see him.
How tartly that gentleman looks!	That man always looks so sour!
I never can see him but I am heartburned an hour after.	Just looking at him gives me heartburn.
He is of a very melancholy disposition.	He has a very gloomy attitude.
He were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between him and Benedick.	It would be excellent if they could make a man halfway between Don John and Benedick.
The one is too like an image and says nothing, and the other too like my lady’s eldest son, evermore tattling.	One of them is too much like a painting of a man—he never speaks—and the other is too much like a spoiled little boy, always chattering.
Then half Signor Benedick’s tongue in Count John’s mouth, and half Count John’s melancholy in Signor Benedick’s face— With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman in the world, if he could get her goodwill.	So, the man would talk half as much as Benedick and be half as serious as Don John— And if he were handsome, agile, and rich, too, he could have any woman in the world—all he’d need was her good will.
By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a husband if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.	Really, niece, you’ll never get a husband if you keep saying such harsh things about people.
In faith, she’s too curst.	Honestly, she is too ill-tempered.
You may light on a husband that hath no beard.	Maybe you will find a husband without a beard.
What should I do with him?	And then what would I do with him?
Well then, go you into hell?	So you’ll go to hell?
No, but to the gate, and there will the devil meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his head, and say, “Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you to heaven; here’s no place for you maids.” So deliver I up my apes and away to Saint Peter.	No, just to the gates of hell, where the devil will meet me, with the horns on his head like a cuckold, and say, “Go up to heaven, Beatrice.
For the heavens, he shows me where the bachelors sit, and there live we as merry as the day is long.	He will show me the part of heaven where the bachelors sit, and I’ll have fun there forever.
Not till God make men of some other metal than earth.	No, I won’t take a husband until they make men out of something other than dirt.
Would it not grieve a woman to be overmastered with a piece of valiant dust?	What woman wouldn’t be distressed, being lorded over by a handful of dust?
To make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl?	Can you imagine being hitched to a lump of clay?
No, uncle, I’ll none.	No, uncle, I won’t be married.
If the Prince be too important, tell him there is measure in everything, and so dance out the answer.	If he is too insistent, tell him that romance is like a dance: it has its own rhythm and timing.
For hear me, Hero, wooing, wedding, and repenting is as a Scotch jig, a measure, and a cinquepace.	The wooing is like a Scottish jig: hot and fast and full of whimsy and illusion.
Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.	Niece, you are exceptionally perceptive.
I have a good eye, uncle.	I have a good eye, uncle.
I can see a church by daylight.	I can see what’s in broad daylight.
The revelers are entering, brother.	The partygoers have arrived.
Make good room.	Let’s give them room.
Lady, will you walk a bout with your friend?	My lady, will you have a dance with me?
So you walk softly, and look sweetly, and say nothing, I am yours for the walk, and especially when I walk away.	As long as you move gracefully, look handsome, and say nothing, I’m yours for the dance.
And when please you to say so?	And when will that be?
When I like your favor, for God defend the lute should be like the case!	When I like the way you look, for God forbid your face be as ugly as your mask!
My visor is Philemon’s roof; within the house is Jove.	My mask is like the roof of the poor
Speak low if you speak love.	If you wish to speak of love, speak more softly.
Well, I would you did like me.	Well, I wish you liked me.
Which is one?	Tell me one.
I say my prayers aloud.	I say my prayers out loud.
I love you the better; the hearers may cry “Amen.” God match me with a good dancer!	That makes me love you even more.
Amen.	Amen.
No more words.	Go ahead—say “Amen.” No more talking.
The clerk is answered.	I’ve got my answer.
At a word, I am not.	No, really, I’m not.
I know you by the waggling of your head.	I can tell by the way you waggle your head.
To tell you true, I counterfeit him.	Really, I’m only pretending to be him.
You could never do him so ill-well unless you were the very man.	You could only imitate his imperfections so well if you were the man himself.
Here’s his dry hand up and down.	Look, you’ve got his wrinkled hands.
You are he, you are he.	You are Antonio, you are he.
At a word, I am not.	In short, I’m not.
Come, come, do you think I do not know you by your excellent wit?	Come on, do you think I can’t recognize you by your excellent wit?
Can virtue hide itself?	Can a good thing hide itself?
Go to, mum, you are he.	Be quiet, you are Antonio.
Graces will appear, and there’s an end.	A man’s virtues will always show themselves, and that’s the end of that.
Will you not tell me who told you so?	Won’t you tell me who told you that?
No, you shall pardon me.	No, you’ll have to excuse me.
Nor will you not tell me who you are?	And you won’t tell me who you are?
Not now.	Not now.
That I was disdainful and that I had my good wit out of The Hundred Merry Tales!	Who said that I was disdainful, and that I got all my best lines out of a bad joke book?!
Well this was Signor Benedick that said so.	Well, it must have been Signior Benedick.
What’s he?	Who’s that?
I am sure you know him well enough.	I’m sure you know him.
Not I, believe me.	No I don’t, believe me.
Did he never make you laugh?	What, he never made you laugh?
In great measure.	Yes, heavily.
There are no faces truer than those that are so washed.	There’s no face more sincere than one washed in tears.
How much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!	And it’s definitely better to cry because you’re happy than laugh because you’re sad!
There was none such in the army of any sort.	There was no Signior Montanto in our army.
What is he that you ask for, niece?	Who are you talking about, niece?
My cousin means Signor Benedick of Padua.	My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.
Oh, he’s returned, and as pleasant as ever he was.	Oh, yes, Benedick has returned and is as cheerful as ever.
I pray you, what is he?	Please tell me, who is this man?
Why, he is the Prince’s jester, a very dull fool, only his gift is in devising impossible slanders.	Why, he’s the Prince’s fool, and a very dull fool at that.
I am sure he is in the fleet.	I’m sure he’s out there dancing.
I would he had boarded me.	I could have sworn he trampled on me.
When I know the gentleman, I’ll tell him what you say.	When I meet this gentleman, I’ll tell him what you’ve said.
Do, do.	Oh, please do.
He’ll but break a comparison or two on me, which, peradventure not marked or not laughed at, strikes him into melancholy, and then there’s a partridge wing saved, for the fool will eat no supper that night.	And that will save a partridge wing from being eaten, because he’ll be too miserable for dinner.
We must follow the leaders.	Come on, we have to follow the leaders of the dance.
In every good thing.	In every good thing they do.
Nay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them at the next turning.	No, if they try to lead us to harm, I will leave the dance floor at the next song.
And that is Claudio.	That’s Claudio.
You know me well.	You know me too well.
I am he.	I am Benedick.
Signor, you are very near my brother in his love.	Sir, my brother is very fond of you.
He is enamored on Hero.	He is in love with Hero.
I pray you, dissuade him from her.	Please make him change his mind.
How know you he loves her?	How do you know he loves her?
I heard him swear his affection.	I heard him swear he did.
So did I too, and he swore he would marry her tonight.	I did too, and he also swore he would marry her tonight.
Come, let us to the banquet.	Come on, let’s get to the banquet.
Thus answer I in the name of Benedick, But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.	Though I said my name was Benedick, I heard this news with Claudio’s ears.
Tis certain so, the Prince woos for himself.	Of course the Prince wants Hero for himself.
Friendship is constant in all other things Save in the office and affairs of love.	Friendship is enduring except when love is involved.
Therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues.	Therefore, all lovers should speak for themselves.
Let every eye nogetiate for itself And trust no agent, for beauty is a witch Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.	Beauty is a witch whose spells can turn loyalty into passion.
Farewell, therefore, Hero.	Goodbye then, Hero.
Count Claudio?	Claudio?
Yea, the same.	Yes, that’s me.
Come, will you go with me?	Will you come with me?
Whither?	Where?
I wish him joy of her.	Right over to that  I hope he enjoys her.
Why, that’s spoken like an honest drover; so they sell bullocks.	You sound like a cattle dealer: that’s the way they sell bulls.
But did you think the Prince would have served you thus?	But do you really think the Prince would treat you that way?
I pray you, leave me.	Please, leave me alone.
Ho, now you strike like the blind man.	Look at you, thrashing about like a blind man.
Twas the boy that stole your meat, and you’ll beat the post.	A boy robbed you, but you’ll beat up the post instead.
If it will not be, I’ll leave you.	If you won’t leave, then
Alas, poor hurt fowl, now will he creep into sedges.	Oh, the poor bird.
But that my Lady Beatrice should know me, and not know me!	But how strange that Beatrice should seem to know who I was and yet not know at the same time.
The Prince’s fool!	The Prince’s fool”!
Ha, it may be I go under that title because I am merry.	Maybe they call me that because I am cheerful.
Yea, but so I am apt to do myself wrong.	Yes, but I am insulting myself by thinking this way.
I am not so reputed!	I don’t have that kind of reputation!
Well, I’ll be revenged as I may.	Well, I’ll get my revenge.
Now, Signior, where’s the Count?	Now, sir, where is Claudio?
Did you see him?	Did you see him?
Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame.	Yes, my lord, I played the part of a gossip and brought him the news.
I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren.	I found him here,  Beating?
What’s his fault?	Why, what did he do?
The flat transgression of a schoolboy who, being overjoyed with finding a birds' nest, shows it his companion, and he steals it.	He was like a schoolboy who finds a bird’s nest and happily shows it to his friend, who then steals it from him.
Wilt thou make a trust a transgression?	What, is trusting a friend such a crime?
The transgression is in the stealer.	The criminal is the one who stole the nest.
The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you.	Lady Beatrice is angry with you.
The gentleman that danced with her told her she is much wronged by you.	The gentleman she danced with told her you insulted her.
She speaks poniards, and every word stabs.	She speaks daggers, and every word stabs.
If her breath were as terrible as her terminations, there were no living near her; she would infect to the north star.	If her breath were as terrible as her words, she would kill every living thing from here to the furthest star.
I would not marry her, though she were endowed with all that Adam had left him before he transgressed.	I wouldn’t marry her, even if she were as blessed as paradise.
Come, talk not of her.	Please, don’t mention her.
Look, here she comes.	Look, here she comes.
Will your grace command me any service to the world’s end?	Your highness, could you send me on a mission to the ends of the earth?
I will go on the slightest errand now to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on.	I’ll go to the Antipodes for any little errand you can think of.
Marry, once before he won it of me with false dice.	Really, he won it from me once before in a dishonest game of dice.
Therefore your Grace may well say I have lost it.	So I suppose your grace can truly say that I have lost it.
You have put him down, lady, you have put him down.	You’ve humiliated him, lady: you’ve put him down.
Why, how now, Count, wherefore are you sad?	Why are you so sad?
Not sad, my lord.	I’m not sad, my lord.
How then, sick?	What then, sick?
Neither, my lord.	I’m neither, my lord.
The Count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry, nor well, but civil count, civil as an orange, and something of that jealous complexion.	The count is neither sad nor sick nor cheerful nor well—he’s just civil, as Seville as an orange, with the same jealous-yellow complexion.
I have broke with her father and his goodwill obtained.	I’ve told her father, and he’s given his permission.
Name the day of marriage, and God give thee joy.	Tell us when you wish to get married, and may God give you joy.
Count, take of me my daughter, and with her my fortunes.	Claudio, take my daughter, and, with her, take my fortunes.
His grace hath made the match, and all grace say “Amen” to it.	The Prince has made the match, and may God bless it.
Speak, Count, ’tis your cue.	Speak, Claudio, that’s your cue.
I give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange.	For you, I give myself away and I’m ecstatic about the exchange.
In faith, lady, you have a merry heart.	Truly, lady, you have a merry heart.
Yea, my lord.	Yes, my lord.
I thank it, poor fool, it keeps on the windy side of care.	I thank my heart—the poor fool—for it keeps away from seriousness.
My cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart.	Look, my cousin is whispering to Claudio that she loves him.
And so she doth, cousin.	Why, you’re absolutely right, cousin.
Good Lord for alliance!	Thank the lord for alliances!
Thus goes everyone to the world but I, and I am sunburnt.	So everyone goes off into the world except me, who stays in because I’m sunburned.
I may sit in a corner and cry, “Heigh-ho for a husband!” Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.	I should sit in the corner and sing that song, “Heigh-Ho for a Husband!” Lady Beatrice, I’ll get you a husband.
I would rather have one of your father’s getting.	I’d rather get a husband from your father.
Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you?	Don’t you have any brothers like you?
Your father got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them.	Your father’s sons would make excellent husbands, if only a girl could catch one for herself.
Will you have me, lady?	Will you take me, my lady?
No, my lord, unless I might have another for working days.	No, my lord, unless I could have another husband for the work week.
Your Grace is too costly to wear every day.	You are too expensive to wear every day.
But I beseech your Grace pardon me.	But please, forgive me, your highness.
I was born to speak all mirth and no  matter.	I was born to speak cleverly, not seriously.
Niece, will you look to those things I told you of?	Niece, will you take care of those things I mentioned?
I cry you mercy, uncle.—By your Grace’s pardon.	Oh, yes, I’m sorry, uncle.—If you’ll excuse me, your grace.
By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady.	I swear, she’s a very good-natured lady.
There’s little of the melancholy element in her, my lord.	There’s very little about her that’s gloomy, my lord.
She is never sad but when she sleeps, and not ever sad then, for I have heard my daughter say she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked herself with laughing.	She’s only sad when she sleeps—and not even then.
She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.	She can’t stand to hear about getting a husband.
Oh, by no means.	No, not at all.
She mocks all her wooers out of suit.	She mocks all her suitors so severely that they drop the suit.
She were an excellent wife for Benedict.	She would make a good wife for Benedick.
O Lord, my lord, if they were but a week married, they would talk themselves mad.	Oh, Lord, if they were married, they’d drive themselves crazy within a week.
County Claudio, when mean you to go to church?	Count Claudio, when do you plan to go to church and be married?
Tomorrow, my lord.	Tomorrow, my lord.
My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten nights' watchings.	My lord, I will help you, even if it means I have to stay awake for ten nights straight.
And I, my lord.	Me too, my lord.
And you too, gentle Hero?	And you, sweet Hero?
I will do any modest office, my lord, to help my cousin to a good husband.	I’ll do any decent thing, my lord, to help my cousin get a good husband.
And Benedick is not the unhopefulest husband that I know.	And Benedick is not the worst husband I can think of.
Thus far can I praise him: he is of a noble strain, of approved valor, and confirmed honesty.	This much I can say about him: he is well-born, has proven his bravery in battle, and has established his good character.
Go in with me, and I will tell you my drift.	Come inside with me, and I will tell you my plan.
Faith, niece, you tax Signor Benedick too much, but he’ll be meet with you, I doubt it not.	But I’m sure he’ll get even with you.
He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.	Signior Benedick served well in the war, my lady.
You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it.	You had rotten food, and he helped you eat it.
And a good soldier too, lady.	He’s a good soldier too, lady.
A lord to a lord, a man to a man, stuffed with all honorable virtues.	He’s a lord to a lord and a man to a man.
He is no less than a stuffed man.	He is positively stuffed with honorable virtues.
But for the stuffing—well, we are all mortal.	Absolutely—he is stuffed, like a dummy.
You must not, sir, mistake my niece.	Please don’t take my niece the wrong way, sir.
There is a kind of merry war betwixt Signor Benedick and her.	Benedick and Beatrice have been waging a war of wits between themselves.
They never meet but there’s a skirmish of wit between them.	Whenever they meet, there’s a little battle.
He hath every month a new sworn brother.	Every month he has a new best friend.
Is ’t possible?	Is that possible?
It is so.	It’s arranged.
The Count Claudio shall marry the daughter of Leonato.	The Count Claudio will marry Leonato’s daughter.
Yea, my lord, but I can cross it.	Yes, my lord, but I can spoil it.
Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be med'cinable to me.	Any obstacle or barrier to Claudio’s happiness will be like medicine to me.
I am sick in displeasure to him, and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges evenly with mine.	I hate him so much it makes me sick, and whoever can ruin his happiness will make me happy.
How canst thou cross this marriage?	How will you wreck this marriage?
Not honestly, my lord, but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me.	I can only do it by lying, my lord, but I can do it so secretly that no one will suspect me.
Show me briefly how.	Quickly, tell me how.
I think I told your lordship a year since how much I am in the favor of Margaret, the waiting gentlewoman to Hero.	I think it was a year ago that I told you how much Margaret, Hero’s servant woman, likes me.
I remember.	I remember.
I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night, appoint her to look out at her lady’s chamber window.	I can arrange it so that at some indecent hour of the night, she looks out Hero’s bedroom window.
What life is in that to be the death of this marriage?	How will that kill this marriage?
The poison of that lies in you to temper.	That part is up to you.
What proof shall I make of that?	What will be my evidence?
Proof enough to misuse the Prince, to vex Claudio, to undo Hero, and kill Leonato.	Evidence enough to deceive the Prince, anger Claudio, ruin Hero, and kill Leonato.
Look you for any other issue?	Is there anything else you wish?
Only to despite them, I will endeavor anything.	That’s all I want, and I’ll do anything to accomplish it.
Go then, find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and the Count Claudio alone.	Find a time to speak with Don Pedro and Claudio alone.
Tell them that you know that Hero loves me.	Tell them you know that Hero loves me.
Intend a kind of zeal both to the Prince and Claudio, as in love of your brother’s honor, who hath made this match, and his friend’s reputation, who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maid, that you have discovered thus.	Pretend to be very concerned about both the Prince, who has compromised his honor by making the match, and Claudio, whose reputation will be ruined by this woman who’s pretending to be a virgin.
They will scarcely believe this without trial.	Of course, they won’t believe you without proof.
Be you constant in the accusation, and my cunning shall not shame me.	If you make the accusation convincingly, then my cunning won’t fail me.
I will presently go learn their day of marriage.	I’ll go now to find out the date of the wedding.
Boy!	Boy!
Signior?	Yes Signior?
In my chamber window lies a book.	In my bedroom window there is a book.
Bring it hither to me in the orchard.	Go get it and bring it to me here in the orchard.
I am here already, sir.	I’m already here, sir.
I know that, but I would have thee hence and here again.	I see that you are here, but I’d like you to go there and then come back again.
I have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife, and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe.	I knew him when he listened to nothing but the military drum and fife; now he would rather hear the sweet and refined music of the tabor and pipe.
I have known when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a good armor, and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet.	I knew him when he would’ve walked ten miles to see a well-crafted suit of armor; now he spends ten nights awake in his room designing himself a fancy new jacket.
I cannot tell; I think not.	I’m not sure, but I don’t think so.
I will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster, but I’ll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster of me, he shall never make me such a fool.	I can’t promise that love won’t transform me, but I can promise you this: until I truly fall in love, a woman will never make me act like such a fool.
Ha!	Ha!
The Prince and Monsieur Love!	Look, it’s the Prince and Mr. Love.
I will hide me in the arbor.	I’ll hide in the arbor.
Come, shall we hear this music?	Well, should we hear some music?
Yea, my good lord.	Yes, my lord.
Come, Balthasar, we’ll hear that song again.	Come on, Balthasar, let’s hear that song again.
O, good my lord, tax not so bad a voice To slander music anymore than once.	Oh, my good lord, don’t make me insult music again with my awful singing.
I pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more.	Come on, please sing.
Note this before my notes: There’s not a note of mine that’s worth the noting.	Just know this before I begin: I can’t play a single note that’s worthy of note.
strange that sheeps' guts should hale souls out of men’s bodies?	Listen to him speaking in quarter notes!
By my troth, a good song.	That’s a good song.
And an ill singer, my lord.	And a bad singer, my lord.
Yea, marry, dost thou hear, Balthasar?	Yes, do you hear me, Balthasar?
I pray thee, get us some excellent music, for tomorrow night we would have it at the Lady Hero’s chamber window	Please, get some excellent music, because tomorrow we want to serenade Lady Hero at her bedroom window.
The best I can, my lord.	I’ll do the best I can, my lord.
Do so.	Please do.
Farewell.	Goodbye.
Come hither, Leonato.	Come here, Leonato.
What was it you told me of today, that your niece Beatrice was in love with Signor Benedick?	What was it that you told me today—that your niece Beatrice was in love with Signior Benedick?
Oh, ay.	Oh yes.
sits.—I did never think that lady would have loved any man.	I didn’t, either.
No, nor I neither, but most wonderful that she should so dote on Signor Benedick, whom she hath in all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor.	But how wonderful that she should be so fond of Signior Benedick, whom she has always appeared to hate.
By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to think of it, but that she loves him with an enraged affection, it is past the infinite of thought.	Really, my lord, I don’t know what to make of it, but she loves him with such a passion that it’s past all understanding.
May be she doth but counterfeit.	Maybe she’s just pretending.
Faith, like enough.	Yes, that’s quite likely.
O God!	Oh God!
Counterfeit?	Pretending?
There was never counterfeit of passion came so near the life of passion as she discovers it.	No one has ever faked passion as skillfully as this, then.
Why, what effects of passion shows she?	Why, what symptoms of love does she exhibit?
What effects, my lord?	What symptoms, my lord?
She will sit you—you heard my daughter tell you how.	She will have a seat—you heard my daughter tell you how.
She did indeed.	Yes, she did tell us.
How, how I pray you?	Please, please tell me!
You amaze me.	This is amazing.
I would have thought her spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection.	I would have thought she was invincible against any assault of love.
I would have sworn it had, my lord, especially against Benedick.	I would have sworn that, too, my lord, especially against Benedick.
Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?	Has she told Benedick how she feels?
No, and swears she never will.	No, and she swears she never will.
That’s her torment.	That’s what’s driving her crazy.
Tis true indeed, so your daughter says.	It’s true, Hero says so.
My daughter tells us all.	My daughter told me everything.
Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a pretty jest your daughter told.	Now that you speak of paper, I remember a funny story of Hero’s.
Oh, when she had writ it and was reading it over, she found “Benedick” and “Beatrice” between the sheet?	Oh, you mean when Beatrice writes a letter and Hero sees that it has “Benedick” and “Beatrice” written all over it?
That.	Yes, that’s the one.
O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence, railed at herself that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her.	Oh, she tears that letter into a thousand small pieces and berates herself for being so forward as to write a letter to a man she knows would mock her.
It is very true.	It’s true.
It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other, if she will not discover it.	If she won’t tell Benedick, someone else should.
To what end?	And what would that accomplish?
He would make but a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse.	He’ll just turn it into a joke and torment the poor woman even more.
An he should, it were an alms to hang him.	If he did that, it would be a charitable deed to hang him.
She’s an excellent sweet lady, and, out of all suspicion, she is virtuous.	She’s an excellent, sweet woman, and there’s no doubt that she is virtuous.
And she is exceeding wise.	And she is very smart.
Oh, my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body, we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory.	Oh, my lord, when wisdom and passion are in one body, it’s ten to one that the passion will win.
I am sorry for her, as I have just cause, being her uncle and her guardian.	I am sorry for her, as I should be, since I am both her uncle and her guardian.
I would she had bestowed this dotage on me.	I wish she were in love with me instead.
I would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself.	I would have thrown away all other considerations and made her my wife.
I pray you tell Benedick of it and hear what he will say.	Please, tell Benedick about her feelings and see what he has to say.
Were it good, think you?	Is that a good idea, do you think?
Hero thinks surely she will die, for she says she will die if he love her not, and she will die ere she make her love known, and she will die if he woo her rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness.	Hero thinks Beatrice will surely die, for she says she’ll die if he doesn’t love her, and that she’ll die before she tells him, and she’ll die if he woos her and she’s made to hold back even one of her usual insults.
She doth well.	She’s probably right.
If she should make tender of her love, ’tis very possible he’ll scorn it, for the man, as you know all, hath a contemptible spirit.	If she offers him her love, it’s very possible that he’ll scorn it, since, as we all know, he tends to be contemptuous.
He is a very proper man.	He’s a very proper man.
Before God, and in my mind, very wise.	And I swear to God he’s very smart.
He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.	He does indeed show sparks of something like wit.
Very easily possible.	It’s entirely possible.
I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.	I can see you don’t like this gentleman.
No.	No, absolutely not.
But I pray you, who is his companion?	But please tell me, who’s his best friend?
He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.	He spends most of his time with the good, noble Claudio.
O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease!	Oh God, Benedick will plague him like a disease!
God help the noble Claudio!	God help Claudio!
If he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a thousand pound ere a be cured.	If he’s caught the Benedick, he’ll lose all his money before he’s cured.
I will hold friends with you, lady.	I’m going to make sure I stay on your good side, lady.
Do, good friend.	Do that, my friend.
You will never run mad, niece.	You will never fall victim to Benedick’s charms, my niece.
No, not till a hot January.	No, not until we see a hot January.
Don Pedro is approached.	Don Pedro is here.
If he do fear God, he must necessarily keep peace.	If he fears God, he must necessarily keep the peace.
If he break the peace, he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling.	If he breaks the peace, he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling.
Well, I am sorry for your niece.	Well, I’m sorry for your niece.
Shall we go seek Benedick and tell him of her love?	Should we go find Benedick and tell him about Beatrice’s love?
Against my will, I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.	Against my will, I’ve been told to bring you in to dinner.
Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.	Lovely Beatrice, I thank you for taking the pains to tell me that.
I took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me.	I didn’t take any more pains bringing this message than you took pains in thanking me.
If it had been painful, I would not have come.	If the job had been painful, I would not have come.
You take pleasure then in the message?	So you took pleasure in bringing me this message?
Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knife’s point and choke a daw withal.	Yes, as much pleasure as one might take in choking a bird at knifepoint.
You have no stomach, Signior.	You don’t want to eat, sir?
Fare you well.	Goodbye, then.
Ha!	Ha!
Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.” There’s a double meaning in that.	Against my will, I’ve been told to bring you in to dinner.” There’s a double meaning in that.
I took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me.” That’s as much as to say, “Any pains that I take for you is as easy as thanks.” If I do not take pity of her, I am a villain.	I didn’t take any more pains bringing this message than you took pains in thanking me.” That’s like saying, “Any thing I do for you is as easy as saying ‘thank you.’” If this doesn’t move me to take pity on her, I’m a horrible person.
If I do not love her, I am a Jew.	If I don’t love her, I’m completely
Good Margaret, run thee to the parlor.	Margaret, run into the sitting room.
There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice Proposing with the Prince and Claudio.	You’ll find Beatrice there, talking to Claudio and the Prince.
Whisper her ear and tell her I and Ursula Walk in the orchard, and our whole discourse Is all of her.	Whisper to her that Ursula and I are walking in the orchard and that we’re talking all about her.
Say that thou overheardst us, And bid her steal into the pleachèd bower Where honeysuckles ripened by the sun Forbid the sun to enter, like favorites Made proud by princes, that advance their pride Against that power that bred it.	Tell her you heard us, and that she should sneak into the arbor where the crisscrossing branches overhead keep the honeysuckles out of the sun.
There will she hide her To listen our propose.	She can hide there and eavesdrop on our conversation.
This is thy office.	This is your job.
Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.	Do it well, and then leave us.
I’ll make her come, I warrant you, presently.	I’ll make her come right away, I promise you.
Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come, As we do trace this alley up and down, Our talk must only be of Benedick.	All right Ursula, as Beatrice arrives, we’ll be walking up and down this alley and speaking about nothing but Benedick.
When I do name him, let it be thy part To praise him more than ever man did merit.	Whenever I mention him, praise him more than any man deserves.
My talk to thee must be how Benedick Is sick in love with Beatrice.	It’ll be my job to talk about how Benedick is sick with love for Beatrice.
Fear you not my part of the dialogue.	Let’s start.
But are you sure That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?	But are you sure that Benedick loves Beatrice that much?
So says the Prince and my new-trothèd lord.	That’s what the Prince and my fiancé say.
And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?	And did they ask you to tell Beatrice about this, madam?
They did entreat me to acquaint her of it, But I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick, To wish him wrestle with affection And never to let Beatrice know of it.	They did want me to tell her, but I persuaded them that, if they truly loved Benedick, they would try to get him to battle his emotions and keep Beatrice in the dark.
Why did you so?	Why did you do that?
Doth not the gentleman Deserve as full as fortunate a bed As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?	Doesn’t Benedick deserve as much luck with a mate as he would have with Beatrice?
What’s the matter, lieutenant?	What’s the matter, lieutenant?
I’ll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle.	I’ll beat him until the welts look like basket-weave!
Beat me?	You’ll beat me?
Dost thou prate, rogue?	Are you talking, you villain?
Nay, good lieutenant!	No, don’t hit him, lieutenant!
I pray you, sir, hold your hand.	Please, sir, restrain yourself.
Let me go, sir, or I’ll knock you o'er the mazzard.	Let me go, or I’ll knock you on the head.
Come, come, you’re drunk.	Come on, you’re drunk.
Drunk?	Drunk?
Alas, gentlemen— Help, ho!— Lieutenant—sir, Montano— Help, masters!—Here’s a goodly watch indeed!	No, lieutenant—God, gentlemen—Help—Lieutenant—sir, Montano—Help, men!—The night guard is coming!
Who’s that which rings the bell?—Diablo, ho!	Who’s sounding that alarm?
The town will rise.	The whole town will riot!
Fie, Fie, lieutenant, You’ll be ashamed for ever.	You’ll be ashamed of this forever!
What is the matter here?	What is the matter here?
He dies!	I’ll kill him!
Hold, for your lives!	Stop right now!
Hold, ho!	Stop!
Hold!	Stop!
The general speaks to you.	The general is talking to you!
Hold, for shame!	Stop, for God’s sake!
For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl.	For heaven’s sake, stop this savage brawl!
He that stirs next to carve for his own rage Holds his soul light, he dies upon his motion.	The next man who swings his sword must not care about his life, because the instant he strikes, he dies.
Silence that dreadful bell, it frights the isle From her propriety.	Stop that alarm from ringing, it’s scaring the islanders.
What is the matter, masters?— Honest Iago, that looks dead with grieving, Speak, who began this?	What’s the matter here, gentlemen?—Honest Iago, you look upset.
On thy love, I charge thee.	Answer me.
I do not know.	I don’t know.
Swords out, and tilting one at other’s breasts In opposition bloody.	I don’t
I cannot speak Any beginning to this peevish odds, And would in action glorious I had lost Those legs that brought me to a part of it.	I’d rather have lost my legs in battle than be a part of this!
Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil.	You’re famous for it.
What’s the matter That you unlace your reputation thus And spend your rich opinion for the name Of a night-brawler?	What in the world made you risk your reputation like this and become a street brawler?
Give me answer to it.	Tell me.
Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger.	Othello, I’ve been seriously hurt.
Nor know I aught By me that’s said or done amiss this night, Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice, And to defend ourselves it be a sin When violence assails us.	I didn’t do anything wrong that I know of, unless it was a sin to defend myself when someone attacked me.
Now, by heaven, My blood begins my safer guides to rule, And passion, having my best judgment collied, Assays to lead the way.	All right, now I’m starting to lose my cool.
Tis monstrous.	That’s unbelievably bad.
Iago, who began ’t?	Iago, who started it?
Touch me not so near.	You’re hitting close to home there.
I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio.	I’d rather cut my tongue out of my mouth than say anything bad about Michael Cassio.
Yet I persuade myself to speak the truth Shall nothing wrong him.	But I don’t think it’ll hurt him to tell the truth.
When I came back— For this was brief— I found them close together At blow and thrust, even as again they were When you yourself did part them.	They were nearly killing each other, as you saw when you pulled them apart.
More of this matter cannot I report.	I can’t tell you anything else.
Though Cassio did some little wrong to him, As men in rage strike those that wish them best, Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received From him that fled some strange indignity Which patience could not pass.	Cassio was wrong to hurt Montano, who was only trying to help him, but I’m sure the guy who ran away must have offended Cassio in some terrible way, and Cassio couldn’t let it pass.
I’ll make thee an example.	I’ll make you an example for the others to learn from.
What’s the matter, dear?	What’s the matter, dear?
All’s well, sweeting, Come away to bed.— Myself will be your surgeon.	Everything’s fine, now, sweetheart.
What, are you hurt, lieutenant?	Are you hurt, lieutenant?
Ay, past all surgery.	Yes, but no doctor can help me.
Marry, heaven forbid!	Oh I hope that’s not true!
But thou must needs be sure My spirits and my place have in their power To make this bitter to thee.	You know I’m powerful enough to make you pay for this.
Patience, good sir.	Please wait, sir.
What tell’st thou me of robbing?	Why are you talking about robbery?
Because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians, you’ll have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse.	We come here to help you and you treat us like thugs, but you let an African horse climb all over your daughter.
You’ll have your nephews neigh to you.	Your grandsons will neigh to you like horses.
You’ll have coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.	Your whole family will be ruined.
What profane wretch art thou?	What kind of crude jerk are you?
I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.	The kind that tells you that the Moor is having sex with your daughter right now.
Thou art a villain!	You’re a villain!
You are a senator!	You’re a senator!
This thou shalt answer.	You’re going to pay for this, Roderigo.
I know thee, Roderigo.	I know who you are.
Sir, I will answer any thing.	I’ll answer for everything.
Reputation, reputation, reputation!	My reputation, my reputation!
My reputation, Iago, my reputation!	Oh, my reputation, Iago, my reputation!
As I am an honest man, I thought you had received some bodily wound.	I swear I thought you meant you’d been hurt physically.
There is more sense in that than in reputation.	Your physical health matters more than your reputation.
You have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser.	You haven’t lost it unless you think you have.
What, man, there are ways to recover the general again.	There are lots of ways to get on the general’s good side again.
Sue to him again and he’s yours.	Go to him, petition him.
Drunk?	Drunk?
And speak parrot?	Babbling senselessly?
And squabble?	Squabbling?
Swagger?	Swaggering?
And discourse fustian with one’s own shadow?	Ranting and raving to my own shadow!
O thou invisible spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by, let us call thee devil!	Oh, wine is the devil!
What was he that you followed with your sword?	Who were you chasing with your sword?
What had he done to you?	What did he do to you?
I know not.	I don’t know.
Is ’t possible?	Is that possible?
I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly.	I remember a jumble of impressions, but nothing distinctly.
A quarrel, but nothing wherefore.	I remember a fight, but not why we were fighting.
That we should, with joy, pleasance revel and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!	Why do we party until we’re like animals?
Why, but you are now well enough.	You seem all right now.
How came you thus recovered?	How did you get better?
One unperfectness shows me another, to make me frankly despise myself.	One weakness led to another, to make me hate myself.
Come, you are too severe a moraler.	Come on, you’re being too hard on yourself.
As the time, the place, and the condition of this country stands, I could heartily wish this had not befallen.	I wish none of this had happened, given the situation here, and your rank.
But since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.	But since this has happened, you should fix it for your own good.
I will ask him for my place again, he shall tell me I am a drunkard.	I’ll ask him for my position back again, and he’ll tell me I’m a drunk.
Had I as many mouths as Hydra, such an answer would stop them all.	Even if I had a whole bunch of mouths, I wouldn’t be able to answer that.
To be now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a beast!	I was a reasonable man, then I became a fool, and finally a beast!
Oh, strange!	Oh, how strange!
Every inordinate cup is unblessed and the ingredient is a devil.	Every glass of liquor is damned, and the devil’s the main ingredient!
Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature, if it be well used.	Come on now, wine is good for you, if you know how to use it.
Exclaim no more against it.	Don’t say anything bad about wine anymore.
And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.	Lieutenant, I think you know I’m your friend.
I have well approved it, sir.	I know that, sir.
I drunk!	Imagine, me, a drunk!
You or any man living may be drunk at a time, man.	Any man can get drunk sometime.
I tell you what you shall do.	I’ll tell you what to do.
Our general’s wife is now the general.	Othello’s wife has a lot of influence now.
Confess yourself freely to her, importune her help to put you in your place again.	Ask her to help you get back your position.
She is of so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition, she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested.	She is so generous, kind, and ready to help that she thinks it’s wrong not to do everything she can, even more than she is asked to do.
This broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter, and, my fortunes against any lay worth naming, this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.	Ask her to help you heal the rift between her husband and you.
You advise me well.	That’s good advice.
I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.	I believe it completely.
I think it freely, and betimes in the morning I will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me.	Early in the morning I’ll go visit Desdemona and plead my case.
I am desperate of my fortunes if they check me.	My situation is desperate.
You are in the right.	You’re doing the right thing.
Good night, lieutenant, I must to the watch.	Good night, lieutenant.
Good night, honest Iago.	Good night, honest Iago.
And what’s he then that says I play the villain?	Who can say I’m evil when my advice is so good?
When this advice is free I give and honest, Probal to thinking and indeed the course To win the Moor again?	That’s really the best way to win the Moor back again.
For ’tis most easy Th' inclining Desdemona to subdue In any honest suit.	It’s easy to get Desdemona on your side.
She’s framed as fruitful As the free elements.	She’s full of good intentions.
How am I then a villain To counsel Cassio to this parallel course, Directly to his good?	How am I evil to advise Cassio to do exactly what’ll do him good?
When devils will the blackest sins put on They do suggest at first with heavenly shows As I do now.	When devils are about to commit their biggest sins they put on their most heavenly faces, just like I’m doing now.
And by how much she strives to do him good She shall undo her credit with the Moor.	The more she
So will I turn her virtue into pitch And out of her own goodness make the net That shall enmesh them all.	And that’s how I’ll turn her good intentions into a big trap to snag them all.
How now, Roderigo!	Hello, Roderigo!
My money is almost spent, I have been tonight exceedingly well cudgeled, and I think the issue will be I shall have so much experience for my pains.	I’ve spent most of my money, and tonight I got beaten up.
And so, with no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice.	So with no money, but a little more wisdom, I’m going back to Venice.
How poor are they that have not patience!	You’re a poor man if you’re this impatient!
What wound did ever heal but by degrees?	No, it heals gradually.
Thou know’st we work by wit and not by witchcraft, And wit depends on dilatory time.	We achieve things with our intelligence, not by magic, and intelligent planning takes time.
Does’t not go well?	Aren’t things going well?
In troth, ’tis morning.	My God, it’s morning.
Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.	All this excitement has made the time fly by.
Retire thee, go where thou art billeted.	Go back to where you’re staying and go to sleep.
Nay, get thee gone.	Go.
Two things are to be done: My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress.	Now two things still need to be done.
I’ll set her on.	I’ll put her on that.
Ay, that’s the way.	Yes, that’s the way I’ll do it.
Masters, play here, I will content your pains.	I’ll pay you for your trouble.
Are these, I pray you, wind instruments?	Are these wind instruments?
Ay, marry, are they, sir.	Yes, they are.
Oh, thereby hangs a tail.	Oh, there’s the problem.
Whereby hangs a tale, sir?	What’s the problem?
Well, sir, we will not.	Well, we’ll stop, then.
If you have any music that may not be heard, to ’t again.	If you’ve got any music that can’t be heard, then play that.
But, as they say, to hear music the general does not greatly care.	But as I said, the general isn’t really in the mood to hear music now.
We have none such, sir.	We don’t have any music that can’t be heard.
Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I’ll away.	Then pack up your instruments and go away.
Go, vanish into air, away!	Go!
Dost thou hear, my honest friend?	Do you hear, my friend?
Prithee, keep up thy quillets.	Please don’t play games.
She is stirring, sir.	CASSIO  She’s awake, sir.
If she will stir hither, I shall seem to notify unto her.	If she feels like coming over here, I’ll give her your message.
In happy time, Iago.	Good to see you, Iago.
You have not been abed, then?	You didn’t go to sleep, then?
Why, no.	No.
My suit to her Is that she will to virtuous Desdemona Procure me some access.	I’m going to ask her to let me talk to Desdemona.
I humbly thank you for’t.	I humbly thank you.
Good morrow, good Lieutenant.	Even for a  Good morning, lieutenant.
I am sorry For your displeasure, but all will sure be well.	I’m sorry about what happened, but I’m sure everything will turn out all right.
The general and his wife are talking of it, And she speaks for you stoutly.	The general and his wife are talking about it now, and she’s defending you strongly.
The Moor replies That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom He might not but refuse you.	The Moor says the man you hurt is very important in Cyprus, and that under the circumstances he has no choice but to refuse to reinstate you.
But he protests he loves you And needs no other suitor but his likings To take the safest occasion by the front To bring you in again.	But he says he still loves and respects you, and based on his own feelings alone he’s looking for an opportunity to safely take you back.
Yet I beseech you, If you think fit, or that it may be done, Give me advantage of some brief discourse With Desdemona alone.	Please find a way to give me some time alone with Desdemona, if you think that’s all right.
Pray you come in.	Please come in.
I will bestow you where you shall have time To speak your bosom freely.	I’ll take you to a place where you can speak freely.
I am much bound to you.	Thank you very much.
These letters give, Iago, to the pilot, And by him do my duties to the senate.	Iago, give these letters to the ship’s captain who brought me here, and ask him to pay my respects to the Senate of Venice.
That done, I will be walking on the works, Repair there to me.	Now that’s done, I’m going to walk on the fortification walls.
Well, my good lord, I’ll do ’t.	I will, my lord.
This fortification, gentlemen, shall we see ’t?	Shall we go see this fortification, men?
We’ll wait upon your lordship.	We’re at your service, my lord.
Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do All my abilities in thy behalf.	I’ll do everything I can for you, Cassio.
Good madam, do.	Please do, madam.
Do not doubt, Cassio, But I will have my lord and you again As friendly as you were.	I’m sure you and my husband will be as friendly as you were before.
You do love my lord.	Yes, my lady.
Ay, but, lady, That policy may either last so long, Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet, Or breed itself so out of circumstances, That, I being absent and my place supplied, My general will forget my love and service.	But those political considerations might last such a long time that the general will forget my love and service, especially if I’m gone and someone else has my job.
My lord shall never rest, I’ll watch him tame and talk him out of patience.	My husband will never get a moment’s rest, I’ll keep him up at night talking about you until he runs out
But if you know not this my manners tell me We have your wrong rebuke.	But if you didn’t know about it, then you were wrong to get mad at us.
Do not believe That, from the sense of all civility, I thus would play and trifle with your reverence.	I’d never play pranks on you.
If she be in her chamber or your house, Let loose on me the justice of the state For thus deluding you.	If she is, you can sue me for lying to you.
Strike on the tinder, ho!	Light the candles!
Give me a taper, call up all my people!	Wake up my whole household!
This accident is not unlike my dream, Belief of it oppresses me already.	I dreamt about this.
Light, I say, light!	Give me some light!
Farewell, for I must leave you.	It’s time for me to say goodbye to you.
It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place, To be producted (as, if I stay, I shall) Against the Moor.	It would be inappropriate—dangerous, even—for me to be seen working against the Moor, as I would if I stayed.
In which regard,	of patience.
Therefore be merry, Cassio, For thy solicitor shall rather die Than give thy cause away.	I’m your advocate, and I’d rather die than give up on you.
Madam, here comes my lord.	Madam, here comes your husband.
Madam, I’ll take my leave.	Madam, I’d better leave now.
Why, stay and hear me speak.	Why not stay and hear me talk to him?
Madam, not now.	No, madam.
I am very ill at ease, Unfit for mine own purposes.	I’m very uncomfortable, and that won’t help my case.
Well, do your discretion.	Well, do whatever you think best.
Ha!	Hey!
I like not that.	I don’t like that.
What dost thou say?	What did you say?
Nothing, my lord, or if—I know not what.	Nothing, my lord, or if I did—I don’t know what.
Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?	Wasn’t that Cassio leaving my wife?
Cassio, my lord?	Cassio, my lord?
I do believe ’twas he.	I really think it was him.
How now, my lord?	What’s this, my lord?
I have been talking with a suitor here, A man that languishes in your displeasure.	I was talking to a petitioner here just now, someone who’s suffering from your anger.
Who is ’t you mean?	Who do you mean?
Why, your lieutenant, Cassio.	Your lieutenant, Cassio.
Good my lord, If I have any grace or power to move you His present reconciliation take.	Oh, if I’ve got any influence over you at all, please patch things up with him.
I prithee, call him back.	Please call him and tell him to come back here.
Went he hence now?	Was that him just now?
Ay, sooth, so humbled That he hath left part of his grief with me To suffer with him.	Yes.
Good love, call him back.	My love, call him back in here.
Not now, sweet Desdemona.	Not now, my sweet Desdemona.
Some other time.	Some other time.
But shall ’t be shortly?	But will it be soon?
The sooner, sweet, for you.	Very soon, because you want it.
Shall ’t be tonight at supper?	Will it be tonight at supper?
No, not tonight.	No, not tonight.
Tomorrow dinner, then?	Then tomorrow at dinner?
Why, then, tomorrow night, or Tuesday morn.	Well then, tomorrow night, or Tuesday morning.
On Tuesday noon, or night, or Wednesday morn.	Or Tuesday noon or at night, or Wednesday morning.
I prithee name the time, but let it not Exceed three days.	Please just name a time, but don’t wait more than three days.
In faith, he’s penitent, And yet his trespass, in our common reason (Save that, they say, the wars must make example Out of her best) is not, almost, a fault T' incur a private check.	His mistake was hardly worth punishing him for in the first place—though in wartime it is sometimes necessary to make examples out of even the best soldiers.
When shall he come?	So when should he come?
Tell me, Othello.	Tell me, Othello.
Trust me, I could do much— Prithee, no more.	I swear, I could do so much— Please, no more.
Let him come when he will, I will deny thee nothing.	I won’t refuse you anything.
Why, this is not a boon, 'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves, Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm, Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit To your own person.	This is like if I asked you to wear your gloves when it’s cold outside, or eat nutritious food, or do something that’s good for you.
Nay, when I have a suit Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed It shall be full of poise and difficult weight And fearful to be granted.	If I ever have to ask you for something that will put your luck to the test, it’ll be something difficult and terrible.
I will deny thee nothing!	I won’t deny you anything!
Whereon I do beseech thee, grant me this, To leave me but a little to myself.	But in return, please, do one thing for me: leave me alone for a little while.
Shall I deny you?	Would I ever deny you anything?
No.	No.
Farewell, my lord.	Goodbye, my husband.
Farewell, my Desdemona.	Goodbye, my Desdemona.
I’ll come to thee straight.	I’ll come see you right away.
Perdition catch my soul But I do love thee!	God help me, I love you!
My noble lord— What dost thou say, Iago?	My noble lord— What is it, Iago?
Did Michael Cassio, when you wooed my lady, Know of your love?	When you were wooing Desdemona, did Michael Cassio know about it?
He did, from first to last.	Yes, he knew about it the whole time.
Why dost thou ask?	Why do you ask?
Why of thy thought, Iago?	Why are you curious, Iago?
I did not think he had been acquainted with her.	I didn’t realize he knew her.
Indeed?	Oh, really?
Indeed?	Oh, really?
Ay, indeed!	Yes, really.
Discern’st thou aught in that?	Do you see something wrong with that?
Is he not honest?	Isn’t he an honest man?
Honest, my lord?	Honest, my lord?
Honest, ay, honest.	Honest, yes, honest.
My lord, for aught I know.	As far as I know, sir.
What dost thou think?	What are you thinking?
Think, my lord?	Thinking, my lord?
Think, my lord?” Alas, thou echo’st me As if there were some monster in thy thought Too hideous to be shown.	Thinking, my lord?” My God, you keep repeating everything I say as if you were thinking something too horrible to say out loud.
Thou dost mean something.	You’re thinking something.
I heard thee say even now thou lik’st not that When Cassio left my wife.	Just a minute ago I heard you say you didn’t like it when Cassio left my wife.
What didst not like?	What didn’t you like?
And when I told thee he was of my counsel Of my whole course of wooing, thou cried’st “Indeed?” And didst contract and purse thy brow together As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain Some horrible conceit.	And when I told you he was involved the whole time I was trying to get Desdemona, you were like, “Oh, really?” And then you frowned and wrinkled up your forehead as if you were imagining something horrible.
If thou dost love me Show me thy thought.	If you’re my friend, tell me what you’re thinking.
My lord, you know I love you.	My lord, you know I’m your friend.
I think thou dost.	I think you are.
For Michael Cassio, I dare be sworn, I think, that he is honest.	As for Michael Cassio, I think it would be safe for me to swear that he’s honest.
I think so too.	I think so too.
Men should be what they seem, Or those that be not, would they might seem none!	If they’re not honest, they shouldn’t look like they are!
Certain, men should be what they seem.	Absolutely, people should be what they appear to be.
Why then I think Cassio’s an honest man.	In that case, I think Cassio’s an honest man.
Nay, yet there’s more in this.	No, I think there’s more to this than you’re letting on.
I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings, As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts The worst of words.	Please tell me what you’re thinking—even your worst suspicions.
Utter my thoughts?	You want me to say what I’m thinking?
Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago, If thou but think’st him wronged and mak’st his ear A stranger to thy thoughts.	You’re not being a good friend, Iago, if you even  Please don’t ask me to tell you.
What dost thou mean?	What are you talking about?
Good name in man and woman, dear my lord, Is the immediate jewel of their souls.	A good reputation is the most valuable thing we have—men and women alike.
Who steals my purse steals trash.	If you steal my money, you’re just stealing trash.
Tis something, nothing: 'Twas mine, ’tis his, and has been slave to thousands.	It’s something, it’s nothing: it’s yours, it’s mine, and it’ll belong to thousands more.
But he that filches from me my good name Robs me of that which not enriches him And makes me poor indeed.	But if you steal my reputation, you’re robbing me of something that doesn’t make you richer, but makes me much poorer.
I’ll know thy thoughts.	I’m going to find out what you’re thinking.
You cannot, if my heart were in your hand, Nor shall not, whilst ’tis in my custody.	You can’t find that out, even if you held my heart in your hand you couldn’t make me tell you.
Ha!	What?
Oh, beware, my lord, of jealousy!	Beware of jealousy, my lord!
It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock The meat it feeds on.	It’s a green-eyed monster that makes fun of the victims it devours.
Oh, misery!	Oh, what misery!
Poor and content is rich, and rich enough, But riches fineless is as poor as winter To him that ever fears he shall be poor.	The person who’s poor and contented is rich enough.
Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend From jealousy!	God, help us not be jealous!
Why, why is this?	Why are you telling me this?
Think’st thou I’d make a life of jealousy, To follow still the changes of the moon With fresh suspicions?	Do you think I would live a life of jealousy, tormented by new suspicions every hour?
No!	No.
To be once in doubt Is to be resolved.	If there’s any doubt, there is no doubt.
Tis not to make me jealous To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company, Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances.	If you say my wife is beautiful, eats well, loves good company, speaks freely, sings, plays music, and dances well, you’re not making me jealous.
Where virtue is, these are more virtuous.	When a woman is virtuous, talents like these just make her better.
Therefore, as I am bound, Receive it from me.	So please listen to me.
I speak not yet of proof.	I’m not talking about proof yet.
Look to ’t.	Watch out!
I know our country disposition well.	I know the people of Venice well.
In Venice they do let God see the pranks They dare not show their husbands.	They let God see things they wouldn’t show their husbands.
Dost thou say so?	Do you really think so?
And so she did.	That’s right, she did.
Why, go to then.	Well, there you go.
She that, so young, could give out such a seeming, To seel her father’s eyes up close as oak, He thought ’twas witchcraft.	She was so young, but she deceived her father so thoroughly he thought it was witchcraft!
But I am much to blame.	But I’m sorry I’ve blurted all this out.
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon For too much loving you.	I beg your pardon for loving you too much.
I am bound to thee forever.	I’m indebted to you forever.
I see this hath a little dashed your spirits.	You seem a little depressed about this.
Not a jot, not a jot.	Not at all, not at all.
Trust me, I fear it has.	Really, I’m afraid you are.
I hope you will consider what is spoke Comes from my love.	I hope you remember that I said all this because I love you.
But I do see you’re moved.	But I see you’re troubled.
I am to pray you not to strain my speech To grosser issues nor to larger reach Than to suspicion.	Please don’t take what I said more seriously than it deserves to be taken.
I will not.	I won’t.
Should you do so, my lord, My speech should fall into such vile success Which my thoughts aimed not at.	If you take it too seriously, it’ll have bad effects that I didn’t want it to have.
Cassio’s my worthy friend— My lord, I see you’re moved.	Cassio’s a good friend of mine—My lord, I can see you’re upset.
No, not much moved.	No, not too upset.
Farewell, farewell.	Goodbye, goodbye.
If more thou dost perceive, let me know more.	If you see anything else, let me know.
Set on thy wife to observe.	Tell your wife to watch her.
Leave me, Iago.	Leave me alone now, Iago.
My lord, I take my leave.	My lord, I’ll say goodbye now.
Note if your lady strain his entertainment	and affection, even if it’s just an act.
That you shall surely find him, Lead to the Sagittary the raisèd search, And there will I be with him.	He and I will be there.
It is too true an evil.	It’s true.
Gone she is.	She’s gone.
And what’s to come of my despisèd time Is naught but bitterness.	The rest of my life will be nothing but bitterness.
Now, Roderigo, Where didst thou see her?—Oh, unhappy girl!— With the Moor, say’st thou?—Who would be a father?— How didst thou know ’twas she?—Oh, she deceives me Past thought!—What said she to you?—Get more tapers, Raise all my kindred.	Now, Roderigo, where did you see her?—Oh, that miserable wretch!—You say you saw her with the Moor?—Oh, who would want to be a father?—How did you know it was her?—To think she tricked me so easily!—What did she say to you?—Get me more candles, and wake up all my relatives.
Are they married, think you?	Do you think they’re married?
Truly, I think they are.	Yes, I really think so.
Oh, heaven, how got she out?	Oh, heaven, how did she get out?
Oh, treason of the blood!	My own flesh and blood rebels against me!
Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds By what you see them act.	Fathers, never trust your daughters just because they act obedient and innocent.
Is there not charms By which the property of youth and maidhood May be abused?	Are there magic spells that can lead young virgins astray?
Have you not read, Roderigo, Of some such thing?	Have you ever heard of anything like that, Roderigo?
Yes, sir, I have indeed.	Yes, sir, I have.
I think I can discover him, if you please To get good guard and go along with me.	I think I can find him.
With any strong or vehement importunity.	giving it back to him.
Much will be seen in that.	That will tell you a lot.
In the meantime, Let me be thought too busy in my fears— As worthy cause I have to fear I am— And hold her free, I do beseech your honor.	But in the meantime, just assume that I’m paranoid—as I’m pretty sure I am—and keep thinking she’s innocent, please.
Fear not my government.	Don’t worry about how I handle it.
I once more take my leave.	I’ll say goodbye once more.
This fellow’s of exceeding honesty And knows all quantities, with a learnèd spirit, Of human dealings.	This Iago is extremely honest and good, and he knows a lot about human behavior.
If I do prove her haggard, Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings, I’d whistle her off and let her down the wind To prey at fortune.	If it turns out that she really is running around on me, I’ll send her away, even though it’ll break my heart.
Oh, curse of marriage That we can call these delicate creatures ours And not their appetites!	Oh what a curse marriage is!
I had rather be a toad And live upon the vapor of a dungeon Than keep a corner in the thing I love For others' uses.	I’d rather be a toad in a moldy basement than to have only a part of someone I love, sharing the rest of her with others.
Yet ’tis the plague to great ones, Prerogatived are they less than the base.	This is the plague of important men—our wives betray us more than those of poor men.
Tis destiny unshunnable, like death.	It’s our destiny, like death.
Even then this forkèd plague is fated to us When we do quicken.	We are destined to be betrayed when we are born.
Look where she comes.	Oh, here she comes.
If she be false, heaven mocked itself.	If she’s cheated on me, then heaven itself is a fake.
I’ll not believe ’t.	I don’t believe it.
How now, my dear Othello?	What’s going on, Othello, darling?
Your dinner, and the generous islanders By you invited, do attend your presence.	The nobles of Cyprus whom you invited to dinner are waiting for you.
I am to blame.	I’m sorry.
Why do you speak so faintly?	Why are you whispering?
Are you not well?	Are you sick?
I have a pain upon my forehead, here.	I have a  That’s from lack of sleep.
Why that’s with watching, ’twill away again.	It’ll go away.
Let me but bind it hard, within this hour It will be well.	Let me wrap up your head, and it will feel okay in less than an hour.
Come, I’ll go in with you.	Come on, I’ll escort you to dinner.
I am very sorry that you are not well.	I’m very sorry you’re not feeling well.
My wayward husband hath a hundred times	hundred times.
Wooed me to steal it, but she so loves the token (For he conjured her she should ever keep it) That she reserves it evermore about her To kiss and talk to.	But she loves it so much (since Othello told her she should always keep it with her) that she always keeps it near her to kiss it and talk to it.
I’ll have the work ta'en out And give ’t Iago.	I’ll copy the embroidery pattern and then give it to Iago.
What he will do with it Heaven knows, not I. I nothing but to please his fantasy.	Heaven knows what he’s going to do with it.
How now!	What’s going on?
What do you here alone?	What are you doing here alone?
Do not you chide.	Don’t snap at me.
I have a thing for you.	I’ve got something for you.
A thing for me?	You’ve got something for me?
It is a common thing— Ha?	It’s a common  What?
To have a foolish wife.	to have a stupid wife.
Oh, is that all?	Oh, is that so?
What will you give me now For the same handkerchief?	And what would you give me for the handkerchief?
What handkerchief?	What handkerchief?
What handkerchief?	What handkerchief?
Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona, That which so often you did bid me steal.	The one the Moor gave to Desdemona, which you asked me to steal so many times.
Hast stolen it from her?	You stole it from her?
No, but she let it drop by negligence And, to th' advantage, I being here, took ’t up.	She dropped it carelessly, and, seizing the opportunity, since I was here, I picked it up.
Look, here it is.	Look, here it is.
A good wench, give it me.	Good girl, give it to me.
What will you do with ’t, that you have been so earnest To have me filch it?	And what are you going to do with it?
Why, what is that to you?	What’s it to you?
If it be not for some purpose of import, Give ’t me again.	If you don’t need it for some important reason, then give it back to me.
Poor lady, she’ll run mad When she shall lack it.	Poor lady, she’ll go crazy when she sees it’s missing.
Go, leave me.	Now go, leave me.
The Moor already changes with my poison.	The Moor’s mind has already become infected with my poisonous suggestions.
Look, where he comes.	Here he comes.
Not poppy nor mandragora Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world, Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep Which thou owedst yesterday.	No drugs or sleeping pills will ever give you the restful sleep that you had last night.
False to me?	She’s cheating on me?
I swear ’tis better to be much abused Than but to know ’t a little.	It is better to be tricked completely than to only suspect a little.
How now, my lord!	What’s with you, my lord?
What sense had I in her stol'n hours of lust?	I had no idea she was cheating on me.
I saw ’t not, thought it not, it harmed not me.	I never saw it or suspected it, so it never hurt me.
I slept the next night well, fed well, was free and merry.	I slept well, ate well, and was happy.
I found not Cassio’s kisses on her lips.	I never saw Cassio’s kisses on her lips.
He that is robbed, not wanting what is stol'n, Let him not know’t, and he’s not robbed at all.	A man who’s robbed, but doesn’t miss what’s stolen, isn’t robbed at all.
I am sorry to hear this.	I’m sorry to hear this.
I had been happy if the general camp, Pioneers and all, had tasted her sweet body, So I had nothing known.	I would’ve been happy if the whole army had had sex with her, the lowest-ranking grunts and all, as long as I didn’t know anything about it.
Oh, now forever Farewell the tranquil mind!	Oh, goodbye to my peace of mind!
Farewell content!	Goodbye to my happiness!
Farewell the plumèd troops and the big wars That makes ambition virtue!	Goodbye to the soldiers and to the wars that make men great!
Oh, farewell!	Goodbye!
Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump, The spirit-stirring drum, th' ear-piercing fife, The royal banner, and all quality, Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war!	Goodbye to the horses and the trumpets and the drums, the flute and the splendid banners, and all those proud displays and pageantry of war!
And O you mortal engines, whose rude throats The immortal Jove’s dead clamors counterfeit, Farewell!	And you deadly cannons that roar like thunderbolts thrown by the gods, goodbye!
Othello’s occupation’s gone.	Othello’s career is over.
Is ’t possible, my lord?	Is this possible, my lord?
Is ’t come to this?	Has it come to this?
Make me to see ’t, or at the least so prove it That the probation bear no hinge nor loop To hang a doubt on, or woe upon thy life!	Show me, or at least prove it beyond the shadow of a doubt.
Oh, heaven forgive me!	Oh, heaven help me!
Are you a man?	Aren’t you a rational human being?
Have you a soul or sense?	Don’t you have any sense at all?
God buy you, take mine office.	Goodbye.
O monstrous world!	What a horrible world we live in!
Take note, take note, O world, To be direct and honest is not safe.	It’s not safe to be straightforward and honest.
Nay, stay.	No, stop.
Thou shouldst be honest.	You should always be honest.
I should be wise, for honesty’s a fool And loses that it works for.	I should always be wise.
By the world, I think my wife be honest and think she is not.	I swear, I think my wife’s faithful, and I think she’s not.
I think that thou art just and think thou art not.	I think you’re trustworthy one minute and then not the next.
I’ll have some proof.	I need proof!
Her name, that was as fresh As Dian’s visage, is now begrimed and black As mine own face.	Her reputation was as pure as the snow, but now it’s as dirty and black as my own face.
Would I were satisfied!	As long as there are
I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion.	I see you’re all eaten up with emotion.
I do repent me that I put it to you.	I’m sorry I said anything.
You would be satisfied?	You want proof?
Would?	Want?
Nay, and I will.	Yes, I want it, and I’ll get it.
And may, but how?	But how?
How satisfied, my lord?	How will you get proof?
Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on, Behold her topped?	Are you going to hide and watch them having sex?
Death and damnation!	Death and damnation!
Oh!	Oh!
It were a tedious difficulty, I think, To bring them to that prospect.	I think it would be very hard to arrange for them to have sex while you watched.
What shall I say?	What can I say?
Where’s satisfaction?	What proof is there?
It is impossible you should see this, Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys, As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross As ignorance made drunk.	It’d be impossible for you to watch them, even if they were as horny as animals in heat and as stupid as drunks.
But yet, I say, If imputation and strong circumstances Which lead directly to the door of truth Will give you satisfaction, you may have ’t.	But if you would be willing to accept circumstantial evidence as proof, we can get that.
Give me a living reason she’s disloyal.	Give me one good reason to think she’s cheating on me.
I do not like the office.	I don’t like what you’re asking me to do.
But, sith I am entered in this cause so far, Pricked to ’t by foolish honesty and love, I will go on.	But since I’ve gotten myself involved this far, because I’m so stupidly honest and because I like you so much, I’ll keep going.
I lay with Cassio lately And, being troubled with a raging tooth, I could not sleep.	I recently shared a bed with Cassio, and I couldn’t sleep because of a raging toothache.
Monstrous!	Monstrous!
Nay, this was but his dream.	No, it was just a dream.
Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.	It’s a reason for suspicion, even though it’s just a dream.
And this may help to thicken other proofs That do demonstrate thinly.	And it might back up other evidence that may seem too flimsy.
I’ll tear her all to pieces!	I’ll tear her to pieces!
Tell me but this, Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief Spotted with strawberries in your wife’s hand?	Just tell me this: have you ever seen her holding a handkerchief with an embroidered strawberry pattern on it?
If it be that— If it be that, or any that was hers, It speaks against her with the other proofs.	If it’s the same one— If it’s the same one, or any one that belongs to her, then together with the other evidence it’s pretty strong.
Oh, that the slave had forty thousand lives!	Oh, I’d kill that bastard Cassio forty thousand times if I could!
One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.	Killing him once is not enough revenge.
Now do I see ’tis true.	Now I see it’s true.
Swell, bosom, with thy fraught, For ’tis of aspics' tongues!	My heart feels like it’s full of poisonous snakes!
Patience, I say.	Be patient, I’m telling you.
Your mind may change.	You may change your mind later.
Never, Iago.	Never, Iago.
Now, by yon marble heaven, In the due reverence of a sacred vow I here engage my words.	I swear to God I’ll get revenge.
Do not rise yet.	Don’t get up yet.
Witness, you ever-burning lights above, You elements that clip us round about, Witness that here Iago doth give up The execution of his wit, hands, heart, To wronged Othello’s service.	Let heaven be my witness—I’m putting my mind, my heart, and my hands in Othello’s control.
Let him command, And to obey shall be in me remorse, What bloody business ever.	Let him command me, and I’ll do whatever he asks, no matter how violent.
I greet thy love Not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous, And will upon the instant put thee to ’t.	I accept your devotion with my deepest love.
Within these three days let me hear thee say That Cassio’s not alive.	Within the next three days I want to hear you tell me that Cassio’s dead.
But let her live.	But let her live.
Oh, damn her, damn her!	Oh, damn her, damn her!
Come, go with me apart.	Come away with me.
I will withdraw To furnish me with some swift means of death For the fair devil.	I’m going inside to think up some way to kill that beautiful devil.
Now art thou my lieutenant.	You’re my lieutenant now.
I am your own for ever.	I’m yours forever.
Pray you lead on.	Lead the way.
At every house I’ll call.	I’ll stop at every house.
I will deserve your pains.	I’ll reward you for your troubles.
Why, man?	Why do you say that?
Go to.	Oh, come on.
Where lodges he?	Where does he sleep?
To tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I lie.	Telling you where he’s sleeping is like telling you where I’m lying.
Can anything be made of this?	What on earth does that mean?
I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here, or he lies there, were to lie in mine own throat.	I don’t know where he’s staying, so if I told you he’s sleeping here or there, I’d be lying.
Can you inquire him out and be edified by report?	Can you ask around and find out?
Seek him, bid him come hither.	Find him and tell him to come here.
Tell him I have moved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well.	Tell him I’ve spoken to my husband on his behalf, and I think everything will be all right.
To do this is within the compass of man’s wit, and therefore I will attempt the doing it.	I think I can do that.
Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?	Where could I have lost that handkerchief, Emilia?
I know not, madam.	I don’t know, madam.
Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse Full of crusadoes.	Believe me, I’d rather have lost a purse full of gold coins.
And but my noble Moor Is true of mind and made of no such baseness As jealous creatures are, it were enough To put him to ill thinking.	This would be enough to make my husband suspect me, if he wasn’t so free of jealousy.
Is he not jealous?	He’s not jealous?
Who, he?	Who, him?
I think the sun where he was born Drew all such humors from him.	I think all tendencies to jealousy were burned out of him by the sun of his native land.
Look where he comes.	Look, here he comes.
I will not leave him now till Cassio Be called to him.—How is ’t with you, my lord?	I won’t leave him alone until he gives Cassio his job back.—How are you, my lord?
Hot, hot, and moist.	Hot, hot and moist.
This hand of yours requires A sequester from liberty, fasting, and prayer,	With a hand like this you need to
Much castigation, exercise devout, For here’s a young and sweating devil here, That commonly rebels.	fast and pray to stave off temptations.
Tis a good hand, A frank one.	It’s a nice hand, an open one.
The hearts of old gave hands, But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.	But these days, people give each other their hands without their hearts.
I cannot speak of this.	I don’t know about that.
Come now, your promise.	Now, don’t forget, you promised me something.
What promise, chuck?	What did I promise, my dear?
I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.	I sent for Cassio to come talk with you.
I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me.	I have a bad cold that’s bothering me.
Lend me thy handkerchief.	Lend me your handkerchief.
Here, my lord.	Here, my lord.
That which I gave you.	No, the one I gave you.
I have it not about me.	I don’t have it with me.
Not?	You don’t?
No, indeed, my lord.	No, my lord.
That’s a fault.	That’s not good.
The thoughts of people.	almost read people’s thoughts.
She told her, while she kept it 'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father Entirely to her love, but if she lost it Or made gift of it, my father’s eye Should hold her loathèd and his spirits should hunt After new fancies.	She told my mother that as long as she kept it with her, my father would love and desire her.
She, dying, gave it me And bid me, when my fate would have me wived, To give it her.	When she was dying she gave it to me and told me to give it to my wife when I got married.
I did so, and take heed on ’t, Make it a darling like your precious eye.	I did.
Is ’t possible?	Is that possible?
Tis true.	Yes, it’s true.
There’s magic in the web of it.	There’s magic in its fabric.
A sibyl, that had numbered in the world The sun to course two hundred compasses, In her prophetic fury sewed the work.	A two-hundred-year-old witch sewed it while she was in a fevered trance.
The worms were hallowed that did breed the silk, And it was dyed in mummy which the skillful Conserved of maidens' hearts.	The silk came from sacred silkworms, and it was dyed with fluid made from embalmed virgins' hearts.
Indeed?	Really?
Is ’t true?	Is that true?
Most veritable, therefore look to ’t well.	It’s absolutely true, so take good care of it.
Then would to Heaven that I had never seen ’t!	I wish I had never seen it!
Ha!	Ha!
Wherefore?	Why?
Why do you speak so startingly and rash?	Why are you yelling at me so angrily?
Is ’t lost?	Is it lost?
Is ’t gone?	Is it gone?
Speak, is ’t out o' th' way?	Tell me, is it missing?
Bless us!	God help me!
Say you?	What do you have to say for yourself?
It is not lost, but what and if it were?	It’s not lost, but what if it were?
How!	What do you mean?
I say, it is not lost.	I’m telling you, it’s not lost.
Pray you, let Cassio be received again.	Please hire Cassio again.
Fetch me the handkerchief—my mind misgives.	Bring me the handkerchief—My mind is full of doubt.
Come, come, You’ll never meet a more sufficient man.	Come on.
The handkerchief!	The handkerchief!
Away!	Damn it!
Is not this man jealous?	And you say he’s not jealous?
I ne'er saw this before.	I never saw him like this before.
They are all but stomachs, and we all but food.	They’re like stomachs and we’re just the food.
To eat us hungerly, and when they are full, They belch us.	They eat us up hungrily, and when they’re full, they vomit us up.
Look you, Cassio and my husband!	Look, here comes Cassio and my husband.
There is no other way.	There’s no other way.
Tis she must do ’t, And, lo, the happiness!	She’s the one who’s got to do it.
Go and importune her.	Go ahead and ask her.
So shall I clothe me in a forced content, And shut myself up in some other course, To fortune’s alms.	Then I could stop wondering, and find some other career.
My lord is not my lord, nor should I know him Were he in favor as in humor altered.	If his face changed as much as his personality has, I wouldn’t recognize him.
So help me every spirit sanctified As I have spoken for you all my best And stood within the blank of his displeasure For my free speech.	God knows I have done my best to argue for you, and made him angry at me for being so aggressive.
You must awhile be patient.	You’ll just have to be patient for a little while.
What I can do I will, and more I will Than for myself I dare.	I’ll do what I can, more than I’d do for myself.
Let that suffice you.	Let that be enough for you.
Is my lord angry?	Is Othello angry?
Can he be angry?	Can he even get angry?
There’s matter in ’t indeed, if he be angry.	If he’s angry, there must be something seriously wrong.
I prithee, do so.	Please, do so.
Something, sure, of state, Either from Venice, or some unhatched practice Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him, Hath puddled his clear spirit, and in such cases Men’s natures wrangle with inferior things, Though great ones are their object.	There must be some political news from Venice, or some dangerous plot here in Cyprus has ruined his good mood.
Tis even so, For let our finger ache and it endues Our other healthful members even to that sense Of pain.	That’s the way it goes.
Nay, we must think men are not gods, Nor of them look for such observances As fit the bridal.	We shouldn’t expect men to be perfect, or for them to be as polite as on the weddingday.
Pray heaven it be State matters, as you think, and no conception Nor no jealous toy concerning you.	I hope to God it’s something political, like you think, and not jealousy involving you.
Alas the day!	Oh no!
I never gave him cause.	I never gave him reason to be jealous.
But jealous souls will not be answered so.	But jealous people don’t think like that.
They are not ever jealous for the cause, But jealous for they’re jealous.	They’re never jealous for a reason; they’re just jealous.
It is a monster Begot upon itself, born on itself.	It’s like a monster that just grows and grows, out of nothing.
Heaven keep the monster from Othello’s mind!	I hope God keeps that monster from growing in Othello’s mind!
Lady, amen.	Amen to that, lady.
I will go seek him.—Cassio, walk hereabout.	I’ll go look for him—Cassio, stay around here.
If I do find him fit, I’ll move your suit And seek to effect it to my uttermost.	If he’s in a good mood I’ll mention you again, and do everything I can.
I humbly thank your ladyship.	I thank you, lady.
Save you, friend Cassio!	Hello, Cassio!
What make you from home?	Why are you so far from home?
How is ’t with you, my most fair Bianca?	How are you, my pretty Bianca?
Indeed, sweet love, I was coming to your house.	To tell you the truth, I was just going to your house.
And I was going to your lodging, Cassio.	And I was just going to yours.
What, keep a week away?	You’ve kept away from me for a week?
Seven days and nights?	Seven days and seven nights?
Eight score eight hours?	A hundred and sixty-eight hours?
And lovers' absent hours More tedious than the dial eightscore times!	And lovers' hours are a hundred and sixty times longer than normal ones!
Oh weary reckoning!	What a tedious wait!
O Cassio, whence came this?	Oh, Cassio, where did you get this?
Is ’t come to this?	Has it come to this?
Well, well.	Well, well.
Go to, woman, Throw your vile guesses in the devil’s teeth From whence you have them.	Oh, come on, woman.
Why, whose is it?	Well, whose is it?
I like the work well.	It’s pretty.
Ere it be demanded, As like enough it will, I would have it copied.	So I’d like it copied.
Take it and do ’t, and leave me for this time.	Take it and do that for me, and leave me alone for a while.
Leave you!	Leave you alone!
Wherefore?	Why?
I do attend here on the general And think it no addition, nor my wish, To have him see me womaned.	I’m waiting here for the general, and I don’t want him to see me with a woman.
Why, I pray you?	And why’s that?
Not that I love you not.	It’s not because I don’t love you.
But that you do not love me.	But you don’t love me.
I pray you bring me on the way a little And say if I shall see you soon at night.	Please, just walk with me a little ways, and tell me if I’ll see you later tonight.
Tis but a little way that I can bring you, For I attend here.	I can only walk a little way with you, since I’m waiting here.
But I’ll see you soon.	But I’ll see you soon.
Tis very good.	All right, have it your way.
I must be circumstanced.	I have to make do.
Nine or ten times I had thought t' have yerked him here under the ribs.	Nine or ten times I wanted to stab him under the ribs.
Tis better as it is.	It’s better that you didn’t kill him.
Nay, but he prated And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms Against your honor That, with the little godliness I have, I did full hard forbear him.	But he kept chattering so foolishly, talking about you in such insulting and despicable terms, that it was hard for me to restrain myself.
Let him do his spite.	But please tell me, sir, is your marriage  Let him do his worst.
My services which I have done the signiory Shall out-tongue his complaints.	The services I have done for the Venetian government will count for more than his complaints will.
Will you think so?	Do you really think so?
Think so, Iago?	What do you mean, do I think so?
What, To kiss in private?	What, just because they kissed in private?
An unauthorized kiss!	An illicit kiss!
Or to be naked with her friend in bed An hour or more, not meaning any harm?	Maybe she was just naked in bed with him for an hour or so, but they didn’t do anything.
Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!	Naked in bed together, but without doing anything?
It is hypocrisy against the devil.	Come on, Iago.
So they do nothing, ’tis a venial slip.	As long as they didn’t do anything, it would only be a minor sin.
But if I give my wife a handkerchief— What then?	But if I gave my wife a handkerchief— Then what?
She is protectress of her honor too.	Her reputation is also her own.
May she give that?	Can she give that away too?
But for the handkerchief— By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.	But a handkerchief— God, I wish I could forget about the handkerchief!
Thou saidst—Oh, it comes o'er my memory, As doth the raven o'er the infectious house, Boding to all—he had my handkerchief.	What you told me it haunts me like a nightmare—he’s got my handkerchief!
Ay, what of that?	Yes, what about it?
That’s not so good now.	That’s not good.
What if I had said I had seen him do you wrong?	What if I’d said I saw him do something to hurt you?
He hath, my lord, but be you well assured No more than he’ll unswear.	Yes, but he’d deny it all.
What hath he said?	What did he say?
Why, that he did—I know not what he did.	He said he did—I don’t know.
Lie—   With her?	He was in bed with— With her?
With her, on her, what you will.	With her, on top of her—however you want to say it.
Lie with her?	In bed with her?
lie on her?	On top of her?
Lie with her—that’s fulsome.	My God, it’s nauseating!
Handkerchief—confessions—handkerchief!	Handkerchief—confessions—handkerchief!
Noses, ears, and lips.	Noses, ears, lips.
Is ’t possible?	Is it possible?
Confess!—Handkerchief!—Oh, devil!— Work on, My medicine, work!	This is the way to trick gullible fools.
How now, Cassio!	Hey, Cassio!
What’s the matter?	What’s the matter?
This is his second fit.	This is his second fit like this.
He had one yesterday.	He had one yesterday.
Rub him about the temples.	Rub his temples.
No, forbear.	No, don’t.
If not, he foams at mouth and by and by Breaks out to savage madness.	If you interrupt it, he’ll foam at the mouth and go crazy.
Look, he stirs.	Look, he’s moving.
Do you withdraw yourself a little while,	Why don’t you go away for a bit?
When he is gone I would on great occasion speak with you.	When he leaves, it’s very important that I talk to you.
How is it, general?	What happened, general?
Have you not hurt your head?	Did you hit your head?
Dost thou mock me?	Are you making fun of me?
Would you would bear your fortune like a man!	I wish you could face your bad news like a man!
A hornèd man’s a monster and a beast.	He’s subhuman, like an animal.
Did he confess it?	Did he confess?
Good sir, be a man, Think every bearded fellow that’s but yoked May draw with you.	Sir, be a man.
Your case is better.	Your case is better than that.
No, let me know, And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.	Then I’ll know exactly what she is, just as I know what I am.
Oh, thou art wise!	You’re wise!
Tis certain.	That’s for sure.
Whilst you were here o'erwhelmèd with your grief— A passion most resulting such a man— Cassio came hither.	While you were dazed by grief—which isn’t appropriate for a man like you—Cassio showed up here.
I shifted him away And laid good ’scuses upon your ecstasy,	I got him to leave, and made up an excuse for your trance.
Bade him anon return and here speak with me, The which he promised.	I told him to come back and talk to me in a bit, and he promised he would.
For I will make him tell the tale anew Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when He hath, and is again to cope your wife.	I’ll make him tell me the whole story again—where, how often, how long ago—and when he plans to sleep with your wife in the future.
I say, but mark his gesture.	I’m telling you, just watch his face.
Marry, patience, Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen, And nothing of a man.	But stay calm, and don’t get carried away by rage, or I’ll think you’re not a man.
Dost thou hear, Iago?	Do you hear what I’m saying, Iago?
Will you withdraw?	Will you go hide?
Now will I question Cassio of Bianca, A huswife that by selling her desires Buys herself bread and clothes.	Now I’ll ask Cassio about Bianca, a prostitute who sells her body for food and clothes.
It is a creature That dotes on Cassio, as ’tis the strumpet’s plague To beguile many and be beguiled by one.	That’s the whore’s curse, to seduce many men, but to be seduced by one.
He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain From the excess of laughter.	Whenever he talks about her he can’t stop laughing.
As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad.	And when he laughs, Othello will go crazy.
And his unbookish jealousy must construe Poor Cassio’s smiles, gestures, and light behavior Quite in the wrong.—How do you now, lieutenant?	In his ignorant jealousy, he’ll totally misunderstand Cassio’s smiles, gestures, and jokes.—How are you, lieutenant?
Alas, poor caitiff!	The poor thing!
Look how he laughs already!	He’s laughing already!
I never knew woman love man so.	I never knew a woman who loved a man so much.
Alas, poor rogue, I think indeed she loves me.	The poor thing, I really think she loves me.
Now he denies it faintly, and laughs it out.	Now he denies it a bit, and tries to laugh it off.
Do you hear, Cassio?	Have you heard this, Cassio?
Now he importunes him To tell it o'er.	He’s asking him to tell the story again.
Go to, well said, well said.	Go on, tell it.
She gives it out that you shall marry her.	She says you’re going to marry her.
Do you intend it?	Are you?
Ha, ha, ha!	Ha, ha, ha!
Do you triumph?	Do you think you’ve won?
I marry her!	Me, marry her?
What?	That whore?
Prithee bear some charity to my wit.	Please give me a little credit!
Do not think it so unwholesome.	I’m not that stupid.
Ha, ha, ha!	Ha, ha, ha!
So, so, so, so!	So, so, so, so!
Prithee say true!	You’re kidding!
Well.	All right, then.
She is persuaded I will marry her, out of her own love and flattery, not out of my promise.	She thinks I’ll marry her because she loves me.
Iago beckons me.	Iago is gesturing for me to come closer.
Now he begins the story.	Now he’s telling the story.
She was here even now.	She was here just now.
She haunts me in every place.	She hangs around me all the time.
I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with certain Venetians, and thither comes the bauble and, by this hand, she falls me thus about my neck— Crying “O dear Cassio!” as it were.	I was talking to some Venetians down by the shore, and the fool showed up.
Ha, ha, ha!	Ha, ha, ha!
Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber.	Now he’s saying how she took him into our bedroom.
Look, where she comes.	Look out, here she comes.
Tis such another fitchew.	Damn you!
What did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now?	What did you mean by giving me this handkerchief?
I was a fine fool to take it.	I was an idiot to take it!
I must take out the work?	You want me to copy the embroidery pattern?
A likely piece of work, that you should find it in your chamber, and not know who left it there!	That was a likely story, that you found it in your room and didn’t know who it belonged to.
This is some minx’s token, and I must take out the work?	This is a love token from some other slut, and you want me to copy its pattern for you?
How now, my sweet Bianca!	What is it, my dear Bianca?
How now, how now?	What’s wrong?
By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!	My God, that’s my handkerchief!
If you’ll come to supper tonight, you may.	If you want to come have dinner with me, you can.
If you will not, come when you are next prepared for.	If you don’t want to, then good riddance.
After her, after her.	Go after her, go.
I must, she’ll rail in the street else.	Actually, I should.
Will you sup there?	Will you be having dinner with her tonight?
Yes, I intend so.	Yes, I will.
Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?	Did you see how he laughed about sleeping with her?
O Iago!	Oh Iago!
And did you see the handkerchief?	And did you see the handkerchief?
Was that mine?	Was it mine?
Yours by this hand.	It was yours, I swear.
And to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife!	And do you see how much your foolish wife means to him?
She gave it him, and he hath given it his whore.	She gave it to him, and he gave it to his whore.
I would have him nine years a-killing.	I wish I could keep killing him for nine years straight.
A fine woman!	Oh, she’s a fine woman!
A fair woman!	A fair woman!
A sweet woman!	A sweet woman!
Nay, you must forget that.	No, you have to forget all that now.
Ay, let her rot and perish and be damned tonight, for she shall not live.	Yes, let her die and rot and go to hell tonight.
Oh, the world hath not a sweeter creature, she might lie by an emperor’s side and command him tasks.	Oh, the world never saw a sweeter creature.
Nay, that’s not your way.	But that’s not how you’re going to be.
So delicate with her needle, an admirable musician.	She’s so good at sewing, and a wonderful musician.
Oh, she will sing the savageness out of a bear!	Oh, she could sing a wild bear to sleep!
Of so high and plenteous wit and invention!	Oh, she’s so witty and creative!
She’s the worse for all this.	All the worse that she stooped this low, then.
Oh, a thousand thousand times—and then of so gentle a condition!	Oh, a thousand times worse, a thousand times—and what a sweet personality she has!
Ay, too gentle.	Yes, a little too sweet.
Nay, that’s certain.	Yes, that’s for sure.
O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!	Oh, it’s dreadful, dreadful, Iago!
If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her patent to offend, for if it touch not you it comes near nobody.	If you still feel so affectionate toward her, then why not give her permission to cheat on you?
I will chop her into messes!	I’ll chop her into pieces.
Oh, ’tis foul in her.	Oh, it’s horrible of her.
That’s fouler.	That’s worse.
Get me some poison, Iago, this night.	Get me some poison tonight, Iago.
I’ll not expostulate with her, lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again—This night, Iago!	I won’t argue with her, so her beautiful body won’t disarm me.—Tonight, Iago.
Do it not with poison.	Don’t do it with poison.
Strangle her in her bed, even the bed she hath contaminated.	Strangle her in her bed, the same bed she’s contaminated.
Good, good, the justice of it pleases!	Good, good, I like that—it’s only fair!
Very good!	Very good!
And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker.	And let me kill Cassio.
You shall hear more by midnight.	You’ll hear more from me by midnight.
Excellent good.	Excellent, good.
Those are the raisèd father and his friends.	That’s her father and his friends, who’ve been roused out of bed.
You were best go in.	You’d better go inside.
Not I, I must be found.	No, I must let them find me.
My parts, my title, and my perfect soul Shall manifest me rightly.	My good qualities, my legal status as Desdemona’s husband, and my innocence will protect me.
Is it they?	Is it them?
By Janus, I think no.	I don’t think so.
The servants of the Duke and my lieutenant?	The servants of the Duke and my lieutenant?
The goodness of the night upon you, friends!	Hello, everyone!
What is the news?	What’s going on?
The Duke does greet you, general, And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance, Even on the instant.	He needs to see you right away.
What’s the matter, think you?	What do you think he wants?
Something from Cyprus as I may divine.	Something about Cyprus.
It is a business of some heat.	I think it’s important.
The galleys Have sent a dozen sequent messengers This very night at one another’s heels, And many of the consuls, raised and met, Are at the Duke’s already.	The warships have sent a dozen messages tonight, one after the other, and many of the senators have been awakened and are at the Duke’s already.
You have been hotly called for.	They’re very anxious for you to get there.
When being not at your lodging to be found The Senate hath sent about three several guests To search you out.	When you weren’t at home, the Senate sent out three different search parties to find you.
Tis well I am found by you.	It’s good you found me.
I will but spend a word here in the house And go with you.	I’ll just speak a word or two here in the house and then I’ll go with you.
What trumpet is that same?	What’s that trumpet for?
I warrant something from Venice.	I think someone’s coming from Venice.
See, your wife’s with him.	Look, your wife is with him.
Save you, worthy general!	Greetings, good general!
The duke and senators of Venice greet you.	The duke and senators of Venice greet you.
And what’s the news, good cousin Lodovico?	What’s new, cousin Lodovico?
I am very glad to see you, signior.	Very nice to see you, sir.
Welcome to Cyprus.	Welcome to Cyprus.
I thank you.	Thank you.
How does lieutenant Cassio?	How is lieutenant Cassio?
Lives, sir.	Well, he’s alive.
Are you sure of that?	Are you sure of that?
My lord?	Excuse me?
He did not call, he’s busy in the paper.	He didn’t say anything, he’s reading.
Is there division ’twixt my lord and Cassio?	So there’s a rift between Othello and Cassio?
A most unhappy one.	Yes, unfortunately.
I would do much T' atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.	I’d do anything to bring them back together, since I really care for Cassio.
Fire and brimstone!	Damn it all!
My lord?	Excuse me, my lord?
Are you wise?	Are you in your right mind?
What, is he angry?	Is he angry?
Maybe the letter moved him, For, as I think, they do command him home, Deputing Cassio in his government.	I think they want him to go home and appoint Cassio governor in his place.
Trust me, I am glad on ’t.	I’m happy about that.
Indeed!	Oh, are you really!
My lord?	My lord?
I am glad to see you mad.	I’m glad you’re insane enough to admit it in front of me.
Why, sweet Othello—   I have not deserved this.	Why, sweet Othello—   I haven’t done anything to deserve this!
My lord, this would not be believed in Venice, Though I should swear I saw ’t.	My lord, no one will believe this in Venice, even though I’d swear I saw it with my own eyes.
Tis very much.	That was too much.
Make her amends, she weeps.	She’s crying.
Oh, devil, devil!	Oh, you devil, you devil!
Out of my sight!	Get out of my sight!
I will not stay to offend you.	I wouldn’t want to stay here and make you angry.
Truly, an obedient lady.	She’s obedient—a fine lady.
I do beseech your lordship, call her back.	Please, my lord, call her back.
Mistress!	Madam!
My lord?	My lord?
What would you with her, sir?	What do you want with her, sir?
Who, I, my lord?	Who, me?
Ay, you did wish that I would make her turn.	See how well she can turn?
Sir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on, And turn again.	She can turn and turn, and then turn on you again.
And she can weep, sir, weep.	And she can cry, sir—oh, how she can cry!
And she’s obedient, as you say, obedient, Very obedient.—Proceed you in your tears.— Concerning this, sir—Oh, well-painted passion!— I am commanded home.—Get you away, I’ll send for you anon.—Sir, I obey the mandate And will return to Venice.—Hence, avaunt!	Very obedient—keep crying.—Concerning this—oh, what fake emotion!—I am being ordered home—Get away from me, I’ll send for you later.—Sir, I’ll obey the order and return to Venice.
Cassio shall have my place.	Cassio can have my job.
And, sir, tonight I do entreat that we may sup together.	And tonight, sir, I invite you have dinner with me.
You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus.	Welcome to Cyprus.
Goats and monkeys!	Horny animals!
Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate Call all in all sufficient?	Is this the same Moor whom the senate considers so capable?
He is much changed.	He’s changed a great deal.
Are his wits safe?	Is he sane?
Is he not light of brain?	Is he losing his mind?
He’s that he is.	He is what he is.
I may not breathe my censure What he might be.	I won’t say anything negative about what he might be.
If what he might he is not, I would to heaven he were!	If he isn’t what he might be, then I wish to God he were!
Strike his wife?	Hitting his wife?
Faith, that was not so well.	It’s true, that wasn’t such a nice thing to do.
Yet would I knew That stroke would prove the worst!	But I wish I could say that’s the last time he’ll do it!
Is it his use?	Is it a habit of his?
Or did the letters work upon his blood And new-create his fault?	Or did the letter make him emotional somehow, and this is the first time he’s done it?
Alas, alas!	Oh, it’s too bad!
It is not honesty in me to speak What I have seen and known.	It wouldn’t be right for me to tell you everything I’ve seen and heard.
Do but go after And mark how he continues.	Just go after him and watch what he does next.
I am sorry that I am deceived in him.	I’m sorry I was so wrong about him.
You have seen nothing then?	You haven’t seen anything, then?
Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.	No, and I didn’t hear anything either, or suspect anything at all.
Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.	But you’ve seen her and Cassio together.
But then I saw no harm, and then I heard Each syllable that breath made up between them.	Yes, but I didn’t see anything wrong, and I heard every syllable they said.
What, did they never whisper?	Didn’t they ever whisper?
Never, my lord.	Never, my lord.
Nor send you out o' th' way?	Or ask you to leave the room?
Never.	Never.
To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?	Not even to get her fan, or her gloves, or her mask, or anything?
Never, my lord.	No, my lord.
That’s strange.	That’s strange.
I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest, Lay down my soul at stake.	I’d swear to you on my soul that she’s a good, honest person, sir.
Bid her come hither.	Tell her to come here.
Go.	Go.
She says enough, yet she’s a simple bawd That cannot say as much.	She says all the right things, but the dumbest brothel-keeper would tell the same story.
And yet she’ll kneel and pray, I have seen her do ’t.	I’ve seen her do it.
My lord, what is your will?	My lord, what do you want?
Pray, chuck, come hither.	Please, dear, come here.
What is your pleasure?	What can I do for you?
Let me see your eyes.	Let me see your eyes.
Look in my face.	Look at my face.
What horrible fancy’s this?	What horrible thing are you imagining?
I understand a fury in your words, But not the words.	I can tell you’re furious, but I don’t understand what you’re saying.
Therefore be double damned, Swear thou art honest!	Go ahead, swear to that, so you’ll be damned to hell for lying.
Heaven doth truly know it.	Heaven knows I am.
Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.	Heaven knows you’re as unfaithful as hell.
To whom, my lord?	Unfaithful, my lord?
With whom?	With whom?
How am I false?	How am I unfaithful?
Ah, Desdemona, away, away, away!	Leave me alone, Desdemona, go away!
Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?	Because of me?
If haply you my father do suspect An instrument of this your calling back, Lay not your blame on me.	If you’ve been ordered back to Venice because of my father, don’t blame me.
If you have lost him, Why, I have lost him too.	You may have lost his respect, but so have I.
Yet could I bear that too, well, very well.	Even that I could put up with.
But there where I have garnered up my heart, Where either I must live or bear no life, The fountain from the which my current runs Or else dries up—to be discarded thence!	be like the fountain that my children and all my descendants flow from, has rejected me!
Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads To knot and gender in!	Worse than that, she’s polluted herself, so that the fountain is a place where disgusting toads copulate and reproduce!
Turn thy complexion there, Patience, thou young and rose-lipped cherubin,— Ay, there, look grim as hell!	Even the goddess of patience couldn’t look at this and be patient—it’s too horrifying!
I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.	I hope you think I’m faithful to you.
Oh, ay, as summer flies are in the shambles, That quicken even with blowing.	As faithful as flies in rotting meat, which give birth to maggots every time the wind blows.
O thou weed, Who art so lovely fair and smell’st so sweet That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst ne'er been born!	Oh, I wish you’d never been born!
Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?	Have I done something to offend you without knowing it?
Was this fair paper, this most goodly book, Made to write “whore” upon?	Was someone as beautiful as you meant to be a whore?
What committed?	What have you done?
Committed?	What have you done?
O thou public commoner!	Oh, you streetwalker!
What committed?	What have you done?
Impudent strumpet!	You brazen whore!
By heaven, you do me wrong!	I swear to God you’re accusing me wrongly!
Are you not a strumpet?	So you’re saying you’re not a whore?
No, as I am a Christian.	No, I’m as honest as I am Christian.
What, not a whore?	What, you’re not a whore?
No, as I shall be saved.	No, I swear it.
Is ’t possible?	Is that possible?
Oh, heaven forgive us!	Oh, heaven help us!
I cry you mercy, then, I took you for that cunning whore of Venice That married with Othello.—You, mistress, That have the office opposite to Saint Peter And keep the gate of hell!	I mistook you for that sly Venetian woman who married Othello.—You whorehouse-keeper.
You, you, ay, you!	You!
We have done our course.	We’ve finished our business.
There’s money for your pains.	Here’s some money for you.
I pray you, turn the key and keep our counsel.	Please lock the door and keep quiet.
Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?	What’s he talking about?
How do you, madam?	How are you, madam?
Ancient, what makes he here?	Ensign, what’s he doing in there?
Faith, he tonight hath boarded a land carrack.	Tonight he boarded a treasure ship.
If it prove lawful prize, he’s made for ever.	If he can keep it, he’ll be set forever.
I do not understand.	I don’t understand.
He’s married.	He’s married.
To who?	To whom?
Here comes another troop to seek for you.	Here comes another group looking for you.
It is Brabantio.	It’s Brabantio.
General, be advised, He comes to bad intent.	He intends to do something bad to you.
Holla!	Hey!
Stand there!	Stop right there!
Signior, it is the Moor.	Sir, it’s the Moor.
Down with him, thief!	Get him, he’s a thief!
With who?	With who?
I have none.	I don’t have a lord.
Do not talk to me, Emilia.	Don’t talk to me, Emilia.
Here’s a change indeed!	Things have certainly changed!
Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.	It’s fair for him to treat me like this, very fair.
How have I been behaved that he might stick The small’st opinion on my least misuse?	What have I ever done that he has anything to complain about?
What is your pleasure, madam?	What can I do for you, madam?
How is ’t with you?	How are you?
I cannot tell.	I don’t know.
Those that do teach young babes Do it with gentle means and easy tasks.	When grown-ups teach little children, they do it gently and easily.
He might have chid me so, for, in good faith, I am a child to chiding.	He might have treated me like that, because I’m as unused to abuse as a little child.
What is the matter, lady?	What’s the matter, lady?
Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her, Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her, That true hearts cannot bear it.	He called her a whore so many times, and heaped up so much abuse on her that good people can’t stand to hear it.
Am I that name, Iago?	Am I that name, Iago?
What name, fair lady?	What name, madam?
Such as she says my lord did say I was.	What my lord said I was.
Why did he so?	Why did he do that?
I do not know.	I don’t know.
I am sure I am none such.	I just know I’m not one.
Do not weep, do not weep.	Don’t cry, don’t cry.
Alas the day!	What a day this is!
Hath she forsook so many noble matches, Her father and her country, and her friends, To be called “whore”?	Did she give up all those chances to marry noblemen, give up her father and country and friends, just to be called a whore?
Would it not make one weep?	Doesn’t that make you want to cry?
It is my wretched fortune.	It’s just my bad luck.
Beshrew him for ’t!	Damn him!
How comes this trick upon him?	How did he get such an idea?
Nay, heaven doth know.	Heaven knows.
I will be hanged, if some eternal villain, Some busy and insinuating rogue, Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office, Have not devised this slander.	I bet my life some evil busybody, some meddling, lying jerk made up this rumor to get some position.
I will be hanged else!	I bet my life on it.
Fie, there is no such man.	Nobody’s that bad.
It is impossible.	It’s impossible.
If any such there be, heaven pardon him!	If there is, then heaven help him!
Why should he call her “whore”?	Why should he call her a whore?
Who keeps her company?	Who’s been with her?
The Moor’s abused by some most villainous knave, Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.	The Moor is being tricked by some crook, some terrible villain, some rotten bastard.
O heavens, that such companions thou’dst unfold, And put in every honest hand a whip To lash the rascals naked through the world Even from the east to th' west!	Oh, I wish we could unmask scoundrels like that, and give a whip to every good man to beat them senseless with!
Speak within door.	Keep your voice down.
Oh, fie upon them!	Oh, to hell with those people!
Some such squire he was That turned your wit the seamy side without And made you to suspect me with the Moor.	It’s the same kind of guy who got you upset and made you suspect I’d cheated on you with the Moor.
You are a fool.	You’re a fool.
Go to.	Shut up.
Alas Iago, What shall I do to win my lord again?	Oh God, Iago, what can I do to win my husband back again?
Good friend, go to him.	Please go to him, my friend.
For, by this light of heaven, I know not how I lost him.	I swear I have no idea why he stopped loving me.
Here I kneel: If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love, Either in discourse of thought or actual deed, Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense, Delighted them, or any other form, Or that I do not yet, and ever did,	Here I’m kneeling to swear that if I ever did anything to destroy his love for me, either by thoughts or actions, or if I ever took pleasure in anyone else, or if I never did love him, or don’t love him now—even though he tries to shake me off—
And ever will—though he do shake me off To beggarly divorcement—love him dearly, Comfort forswear me!	then I hope I have a life of misery!
Unkindness may do much, And his unkindness may defeat my life, But never taint my love.	Unkindness is powerful, and his unkindness may kill me, but it’ll never destroy my love.
I cannot say “whore,” It does abhor me now I speak the word.	I can’t say “whore.” It makes me sick to say the word even now.
The business of the state does him offence, And he does chide with you.	Political business is bothering him, and he’s just taking it out on you.
If ’twere no other— 'Tis but so, I warrant.	If only that were all it is— It is, I promise.
Hark, how these instruments summon to supper.	Those trumpets are calling us in to dinner.
The messengers of Venice stays the meat.	The Venetians are waiting for their food.
Go in, and weep not.	Go in, and don’t cry.
All things shall be well.	Everything will be all right.
How now, Roderigo!	How are you, Roderigo?
I do not find that thou deal’st justly with me.	I don’t think you’re treating me fairly.
What in the contrary?	What makes you say that?
I will indeed no longer endure it, nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what already I have foolishly suffered.	Well, I won’t take it any longer.
Will you hear me, Roderigo?	Will you listen to me, Roderigo?
I have heard too much, and your words and performances are no kin together.	Your words and actions don’t match up.
You charge me most unjustly.	That’s not fair.
With naught but truth.	It’s the truth.
The jewels you have had from me to deliver Desdemona would half have corrupted a votaress.	The jewels you took from me to deliver to Desdemona would’ve made even a nun want to sleep with me.
You have told me she hath received them and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance, but I find none.	You told me she got them, and that she promised to give me a little something in return soon, but nothing like that ever happens.
Well, go to.	Well, all right then.
Very well.	Fine.
Very well,” “go to”!	Fine!” he says.
I cannot go to, man, nor ’tis not very well.	All right!” It’s not fine, and I’m not all right!
Nay, I think it is scurvy, and begin to find myself fopped in it.	It’s wrong, and I’m starting to realize I’m being cheated!
Very well.	Okay.
I tell you ’tis not very well.	It’s not okay!
I will make myself known to Desdemona.	I’m going to tell Desdemona my feelings.
If she will return me my jewels I will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation.	If she returns my jewels, I’ll stop pursuing her and apologize to her.
If not, assure yourself I will seek satisfaction of you.	If not, I’ll challenge you to a duel.
You have said now.	You’ve said what you have to say now.
Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing.	Yes, and I’ll do everything I just said.
Why, now I see there’s mettle in thee, and even from this instant to build on thee a better opinion than ever before.	From this moment on I have a higher opinion of you than before.
Give me thy hand, Roderigo.	Give me your hand, Roderigo.
Thou hast taken against me a most just exception, but yet I protest I have dealt most directly in thy affair.	Your complaint against me is perfectly understandable, but I still insist I’ve done everything I could to help you.
It hath not appeared.	It doesn’t look that way to me.
I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your suspicion is not without wit and judgment.	I admit it doesn’t look that way to me, and the fact that you suspect me shows that you’re smart.
But, Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I have greater reason to believe now than ever—I mean purpose, courage and valor—this night show it.	But Roderigo, if you’re as courageous and determined as I think you are, then wait just a bit longer.
If thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona, take me from this world with treachery and devise engines for my life.	If you’re not having sex with Desdemona tomorrow night, then I suggest you find some way to stab me in the back and kill me.
Well, what is it?	Well, what’s your plan?
Is it within reason and compass?	Is it feasible?
Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute Cassio in Othello’s place.	Venice has made Cassio governor here on Cyprus.
Is that true?	Is that true?
Why, then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice.	Then Desdemona and Othello will go back to Venice.
How do you mean, removing of him?	What do you mean, get rid of him?
Why, by making him uncapable of Othello’s place: knocking out his brains.	I mean knock his brains out, so he can’t take Othello’s place.
And that you would have me to do!	And that’s what you want me to do!
Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right.	Yes, if you want to help yourself.
He sups tonight with a harlotry, and thither will I go to him.	He’s having dinner tonight with a prostitute, and I’ll go visit him.
He knows not yet of his honorable fortune.	He doesn’t know he’s been appointed governor yet.
If you will watch his going thence (which I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one) you may take him at your pleasure.	When you see him walking by here (as I’ll make sure he does between twelve and one) you can nab him.
I will be near to second your attempt, and he shall fall between us.	I’ll be nearby to help you, and between the two of us we can handle him.
I will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him.	I’ll give you such reasons for killing him that you’ll feel obliged to snuff him out.
It is now high suppertime, and the night grows to waste.	It’s nearly dinner time, and the night’s going to be wasted.
About it!	Let’s go!
I will hear further reason for this.	I want to hear more about this.
And you shall be satisfied.	You will.
I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further.	Please, sir, don’t trouble yourself.
Madam, good night.	Good night, madam.
I humbly thank your ladyship.	Thank you.
Your honor is most welcome.	You’re most welcome.
Will you walk, sir?—O Desdemona— My lord?	Would you walk out with me, sir?—Oh, Desdemona— Yes, my lord?
Get you to bed on th' instant, I will be returned Forthwith.	Go to bed right this minute.
Dismiss your attendant there, look ’t be done.	I’ll be there shortly.
I will, my lord.	I will, my lord.
How goes it now?	How are things now?
He looks gentler than he did.	He looks calmer than he did before.
Dismiss me?	Send me away?
It was his bidding.	That’s what he said.
Therefore, good Emilia, Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu.	So give me my nightgown, Emilia, and I’ll say goodnight.
We must not now displease him.	We shouldn’t displease him.
Ay.	Yes.
Would you had never seen him!	I wish you’d never met him.
So would not I.	That’s not what I wish.
My love doth so approve him That even his stubbornness, his checks, his frowns— Prithee, unpin me—have grace and favor.	I love him even when he’s harsh and mean—Help me unpin this, would you?—I love even his stubbornness, his frowns, his bad moods.
I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.	I put those wedding sheets on your bed, as you asked.
All’s one.	It doesn’t matter.
Good Father, how foolish are our minds!	Oh, how silly we are!
If I do die before thee, prithee, shroud me In one of these same sheets.	If I die before you do make sure I’m wrapped in those sheets in my coffin.
Come, come!	Listen to you!
You talk!	Don’t be silly!
She had a song of “Willow,” An old thing ’twas, but it expressed her fortune And she died singing it.	She knew an old song called “Willow” that reminded her of her own story, and she died singing it.
That song tonight Will not go from my mind.	I can’t get that song out of my head tonight.
I have much to do But to go hang my head all at one side And sing it like poor Barbary.	It’s all I can do to keep myself from hanging my head down in despair and singing it like poor Barbary.
Prithee, dispatch.	Please, hurry up.
Shall I go fetch your nightgown?	Should I get your nightgown?
No, unpin me here.	No, just help me unpin this.
This Lodovico is a proper man.	That Lodovico is a good-looking man.
A very handsome man.	He’s very handsome.
He speaks well.	He speaks well.
I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.	I know a lady in Venice who’d walk all the way to Palestine for a kiss from him.
It’s the wind.	It’s the wind.
Mine eyes do itch, Doth that bode weeping?	My eyes itch—is that an omen I’ll be crying soon?
Tis neither here nor there.	No, it doesn’t mean anything.
I have heard it said so.	I heard someone say that’s what it means.
Oh, these men, these men!	Oh, these men, these men!
Dost thou in conscience think—tell me, Emilia— That there be women do abuse their husbands In such gross kind?	Do you honestly think—tell me, Emilia—there are women who’d cheat on their husbands in such a disgusting manner?
There be some such, no question.	There are women like that out there, no question.
You, Roderigo!	You, Roderigo!
Come, sir, I am for you.	Come on, I’ll fight you.
Good signior, you shall more command with years Than with your weapons.	Sir, your age and status inspire more respect than your weapons do.
O thou foul thief, where hast thou stowed my daughter?	You evil thief, where have you hidden my daughter?
Damned as thou art, thou hast enchanted her!	You devil, you’ve put a spell on her!
Judge me the world if ’tis not gross in sense That thou hast practiced on her with foul charms, Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals That weakens motion.	It’s obvious to everyone that you’ve tricked her, drugged her, or kidnapped her.
If he do resist, Subdue him at his peril!	If he struggles, use force!
Whither will you that I go To answer this your charge?	Where do you want me to go to respond to these charges?
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?	Would you ever do such a thing for all the world?
Why, would not you?	Why, wouldn’t you?
No, by this heavenly light!	By the light of heaven, no, I would not!
Nor I neither, by this heavenly light.	I wouldn’t either, by daylight.
I might do ’t as well i' th' dark.	It would be easier to do it in the dark.
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?	Could you really do such a thing, for all the world?
The world’s a huge thing.	The world’s huge.
It is a great price for a small vice.	It’s a big prize for such a small sin.
In troth, I think thou wouldst not.	I don’t think you would.
In troth, I think I should, and undo ’t when I had done.	Actually I think I would, and then I’d undo it after I did it.
Marry, I would not do such a thing for a joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty exhibition.	I wouldn’t do it for a nice ring, or fine linen, or pretty gowns or petticoats or hats.
But for the whole world?	But for the whole world?
Why, who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch?	Who wouldn’t cheat on her husband to make him king?
I should venture purgatory for ’t.	I’d risk my soul for that.
Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong For the whole world.	I’d never do such a bad thing, not for the whole world!
Why the wrong is but a wrong i' th' world, and having the world for your labor, ’tis a wrong in your own world, and you might quickly make it right.	Why, a bad action is just a wrong in this world, but when you’ve won the whole world, it’s a wrong in your own world, so you can make it right then.
I do not think there is any such woman.	I don’t think any woman like that exists.
Yes, a dozen, and as many to th' vantage as would store the world they played for.	Yes, a dozen of them—as many as there are women in the world, in fact.
But I do think it is their husbands' faults If wives do fall.	But I do think it’s the husband’s fault if we wives cheat on them.
Say that they slack their duties	For instance, our husbands
Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace, Yet have we some revenge.	We have feelings.
Let husbands know Their wives have sense like them.	Husbands need to know that their wives are human beings too.
They see and smell And have their palates both for sweet and sour, As husbands have.	They see, smell, and taste sweet and sour just like their husbands.
I think it is.	I think they do.
And doth affection breed it?	Is it out of lust?
I think it doth.	I think so.
Is ’t frailty that thus errs?	Is it a weakness?
It is so too.	It is.
And have not we affections, Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?	And don’t we have passions, and a taste for fun, and weaknesses, just like men?
Then let them use us well, else let them know, The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.	Then tell them to treat us well.
Good night, good night.	Good night, good night.
Heaven me such uses send, Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!	I pray that God will let me learn from women like that—not to follow their bad example, but to avoid it!
Here, stand behind this bulk, straight will he come.	Here, stand behind this wall; he’ll come right away.
Quick, quick!	Quick, quick.
Fear nothing.	Don’t be afraid.
I’ll be at thy elbow.	I’ll be right next to you.
It makes us, or it mars us.	This will either make us or break us.
Here, at thy hand.	I’m right behind you.
Be bold, and take thy stand.	Be bold, and get ready.
I have no great devotion to the deed And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons.	I don’t really want to do this, but he’s given me good reasons.
Tis but a man gone.	I guess it’s only one man—no big deal.
I know his gait, ’tis he.—Villain, thou diest!	I know the sound of his walk.—Die, villain!
Oh, I am slain!	Oh, I’m dead!
I am maimed for ever.	I’ll be crippled forever!
Help, ho!	Help!
Murder!	Murder!
Murder!	murder!
The voice of Cassio.	That’s Cassio’s voice.
Iago keeps his word.	Iago has kept his word.
Oh, villain that I am!	Oh, what a villain I am!
It is even so.	That’s the truth.
Oh, help, ho!	Help me!
Light!	Get some light!
A surgeon!	Get me a surgeon!
Tis he.	It’s him!
Oh, brave Iago, honest and just, That hast such noble sense of thy friend’s wrong!	Brave Iago, how honest and trustworthy you are!
Thou teachest me.	You teach me how I should act.
Minion, your dear lies dead, And your unblest fate hies.	Whore, your lover’s dead now, and you’ll be going to hell soon.
Strumpet, I come.	I’m coming, slut!
For, of my heart, those charms, thine eyes, are blotted.	I’ve shut the memory of your beautiful eyes out of my heart.
Thy bed, lust-stained, shall with lust’s blood be spotted.	You’ve already stained our sheets with your lust; now I’ll stain them with your whore’s blood.
What, ho!	Help!
No watch?	Isn’t there a guard around?
No passage?	No one passing by?
Murder!	Murder!
Murder!	Murder!
Tis some mischance, the cry is very direful.	Something’s wrong, the man sounds panicked.
Oh, help!	Oh, help!
Hark!	Listen!
Oh, wretched villain!	I’ve acted like such a villain!
Two or three groan.	Two or three men are groaning.
Tis heavy night, These may be counterfeits.	But it’s dark out, and it could be a trap.
Let’s think ’t unsafe To come in to the cry without more help.	It’s not safe to go near them till we get more help.
Nobody come?	Nobody’s coming?
Then shall I bleed to death.	I’ll bleed to death.
Hark!	Look!
Here’s one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons.	Here’s someone coming in his pajamas, with a candle and weapons.
Who’s there?	Who’s there?
Whose noise is this that ones on murder?	Who’s shouting “murder”?
We do not know.	We don’t know.
Do not you hear a cry?	Didn’t you hear someone shouting?
Here, here!	I’m here, here!
For heaven’s sake, help me!	For heaven’s sake, help me!
The same indeed, a very valiant fellow.	He’s a good man.
Iago?	Is that you, Iago?
Oh, I am spoiled, undone by villains!	I’m here, I’ve been destroyed by villains!
Give me some help.	Help me.
Oh, me, lieutenant!	Oh, lieutenant!
What villains have done this?	What villains did this to you?
I think that one of them is hereabout, And cannot make away.	I think one of them is nearby and can’t get away.
That’s one of them.	That’s one of them.
O damned Iago!	Damned Iago!
O inhuman dog!	You inhuman dog!
Kill men i' th' dark!	Killing men in the dark?
Where be these bloody thieves?	Where are these murderers?
Are you of good or evil?	Are you good or evil?
As you shall prove us, praise us.	Judge for yourself.
Signior Lodovico?	Signor Lodovico?
He, sir.	That’s me.
I cry you mercy.	I beg your pardon.
Here’s Cassio hurt by villains.	Cassio’s been wounded.
Cassio!	Cassio!
How is ’t, brother!	How are you doing, brother?
My leg is cut in two.	My leg’s been cut in two.
Marry, heaven forbid!	God forbid!
Light, gentlemen, I’ll bind it with my shirt.	Bring me some light, gentlemen, I’ll bind the wound with my shirt.
What is the matter, ho?	What’s the matter?
Who is ’t that cried?	Who’s shouting?
Who is ’t that cried?	Who’s shouting?
Oh, my dear Cassio!	Oh, my dear Cassio!
My sweet Cassio!	My sweet Cassio!
O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!	Oh, Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!
O notable strumpet!	You notorious whore!
Cassio, may you suspect Who they should be that have thus mangled you?	Cassio, do you know who might have stabbed you like this?
No.	No.
I am sorry to find you thus.	I’m sorry to find you like this.
I have been to seek you.	I’ve been looking all over for you.
Alas, he faints!	He’s fainted!
O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!	Oh Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!
Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash To be a party in this injury.— Patience awhile, good Cassio.—Come, come, Lend me a light.	Sir, I believe this piece of trash, Bianca, has something to do with all this trouble.—Hang in there, Cassio.—Come here, bring the light.
Know we this face or no?	Do you recognize this face?
Even he, sir.	That’s the one, sir.
Did you know him?	Do you know him?
Know him?	Know him?
Ay.	Yes.
I am glad to see you.	I’m glad to see you.
How do you, Cassio?—Oh, a chair, a chair!	How are you doing, Cassio?—Someone bring me a stretcher!
Roderigo!	Roderigo!
He, he, ’tis he.	It’s him, it’s him.
Oh, that’s well said—the chair!	Good—here’s the stretcher.
Some good man bear him carefully from hence.	Get somebody strong to carry him out of here.
I’ll fetch the general’s surgeon.— Save you your labor.—He that lies slain here, Cassio, Was my dear friend.	I’ll get the general’s surgeon.
What malice was between you?	There wasn’t any problem.
None in the world, nor do I know the man.	I don’t even know him.
I pray you, look upon her.	Keep an eye on her.
Do you see, gentlemen?	Do you see?
Nay, guiltiness Will speak, though tongues were out of use.	The guilty speak volumes even when they’re silent.
Alas, what is the matter?	What’s the matter?
What is the matter, husband?	What’s the matter, husband?
Cassio hath here been set on in the dark By Roderigo and fellows that are ’scaped.	Cassio was attacked here in the dark by Roderigo and men who escaped.
He’s almost slain, and Roderigo dead.	He’s near death, and Roderigo’s dead already.
Alas, good gentleman!	Oh, no, good gentleman!
Alas, good Cassio!	Oh no, good Cassio!
This is the fruits of whoring.	This is what happens when you visit whores.
Prithee, Emilia, Go know of Cassio where he supped tonight.—	Please, Emilia, ask Cassio where he was at dinner tonight.—
He supped at my house, but I therefore shake not.	He ate at my house, but that doesn’t make me nervous.
Oh, did he so?	Oh, did he?
I charge you, go with me.	I order you to come with me.
Oh, fie upon thee, strumpet!	Go to hell, you whore!
As I!	As moral as me!
Fie upon thee!	Damn you!
Kind gentlemen, let’s go see poor Cassio dressed.— Come, mistress, you must tell ’s another tale.	Gentlemen, let’s go make sure Cassio’s wounds are properly dressed.—Come on, ma'am, you can tell us another story.
Emilia, run you to the citadel And tell my lord and lady what hath happed.— Will you go on afore?	Emilia, go to the castle and tell Othello and Desdemona what happened.—Will you please go now?
This is the night That either makes me or fordoes me quite.	To prison, until you’re called into court.
How may the Duke be therewith satisfied, Whose messengers are here about my side Upon some present business of the state To bring me to him?	His messengers are waiting here to take me to him immediately, on pressing state business.
Tis true, most worthy signior.	It’s true.
The Duke’s in council and your noble self, I am sure, is sent for.	The Duke’s in a meeting right now, and he’s sent for you too.
The Duke in council?	The Duke’s in a meeting?
In this time of the night?	At this time of night?
Bring him away.	Bring him with us.
Mine’s not an idle cause.	The law’s on my side.
The Duke himself, Or any of my brothers of the state, Cannot but feel this wrong as ’twere their own.	The Duke and any of my fellow senators will take this wrong as seriously as if it were their own.
For if such actions may have passage free, Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.	If we let crimes like this happen, slaves and heathens will be our rulers.
Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars, It is the cause.	I have to do it, I have to do it.
Yet I’ll not shed her blood, Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow And smooth as monumental alabaster.	But I won’t shed any of her blood or scar that beautiful skin, whiter than snow and smooth as the finest marble.
Yet she must die, else she’ll betray more men.	But she’s got to die, or she’ll cheat on other men.
Put out the light, and then put out the light.	Put out the light of the candle, and then put out the light of her heart.
If I quench thee, thou flaming minister, I can again thy former light restore Should I repent me.	If I extinguish the candle, I can light it again if I regret it.
When I have plucked thy rose I cannot give it vital growth again, It must needs wither.	When I’ve plucked this rose, I can’t make it grow again; it will have no choice but to wither and die.
Who’s there?	Who’s there?
Othello?	Othello?
Ay, Desdemona.	Yes, Desdemona.
Will you come to bed, my lord?	Will you come to bed, my lord?
Ay, my lord.	Yes, my lord.
Alack, my lord, what do you mean by that?	Oh, my lord, what do you mean by that?
Well, do it, and be brief.	Be quick about it.
I will walk by.	I’ll wait over here.
I would not kill thy unpreparèd spirit.	I don’t want to kill you before you’ve readied your soul.
No, heavens forfend, I would not kill thy soul!	No, I don’t want to send your soul to hell when I kill you.
Talk you of killing?	You’re talking about killing?
Ay, I do.	Yes, I am.
Then heaven Have mercy on me!	Then heaven have mercy on me.
Amen, with all my heart.	Amen to that, from the bottom of my heart.
If you say, I hope you will not kill me.	If you really feel that way, then I hope you won’t kill me.
Humh!	Hmmph!
Why I should fear I know not, Since guiltiness I know not.	I don’t know why I should be afraid, since I haven’t done anything wrong.
But yet I feel I fear.	But I’m still afraid.
Think on thy sins.	Think of your sins.
They are loves I bear to you.	My only sin was loving you too much.
Ay, and for that thou diest.	Yes, that’s why you have to die.
That death’s unnatural that kills for loving.	You’re wrong to kill me for loving you.
Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?	Why are you chewing on your lower lip like that?
Some bloody passion shakes your very frame.	You’re shaking with emotion.
These are portents, but yet I hope, I hope They do not point on me.	These are bad omens, but I hope, I hope, they don’t predict my future.
I will so.	I will.
What’s the matter?	What’s this all about?
That handkerchief Which I so loved and gave thee, thou gav’st To Cassio.	You gave that handkerchief, the one I loved and gave to you, to Cassio.
No, by my life and soul!	No, I swear by my life and soul!
Send for the man and ask him.	Bring him here and ask him.
Thou art on thy deathbed.	You’re on your deathbed.
Ay—but not yet to die!	But I’m not dying yet!
Presently.	Yes, right now.
Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin, For to deny each article with oath Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception That I do groan withal.	So confess your sin freely now.
Thou art to die.	You’re going to die.
Oh, heaven have mercy on me!	Then heaven have mercy on me!
I say “amen.”	Amen to that.
And have you mercy too!	And you have mercy on me too!
I never gave him token.	I never gave him any token of romantic love.
By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in ’s hand.	I saw him holding the handkerchief!
O perjured woman, thou dost stone my heart, And mak’st me call what I intend to do A murder, which I thought a sacrifice!	You liar, you’re turning my heart to stone, and making me call what I’ll do murder, when I had been thinking of it as a sacrifice!
I saw the handkerchief.	I saw the handkerchief.
He hath confessed.	He’s already done so.
What, my lord?	What, my lord?
That he hath usèd thee.	That he had sex with you.
How?	What?
Ay.	Yes.
He will not say so.	He wouldn’t say that.
No, his mouth is stopped.	No.
Honest Iago Hath ta'en order for ’t.	Honest Iago’s arranged that.
What, is he dead?	What, is he dead?
Had all his hairs been lives My great revenge had stomach for them all.	If he had as many lives as he’s got hairs on his head, I would’ve killed them all in revenge.
Alas, he is betrayed and I undone.	Oh, he’s been betrayed, and I’ve been ruined.
Oh, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!	Send me away, my lord, but don’t kill me!
Kill me tomorrow—let me live tonight!	Kill me tomorrow—but let me live tonight.
Nay, if you strive— But half an hour!	No, if you struggle with me— Just half an hour!
But while I say one prayer!	Just let me say one prayer!
It is too late.	It’s too late.
What noise is this?—Not dead?	What’s that noise?
Not yet quite dead?	Aren’t you dead yet?
Who’s there?	Who’s there?
Yes, ’tis Emilia.— 'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio’s death, The noise was high.	Yes, it’s Emilia.
What’s the matter with thee now?	What’s the matter with you now?
But now, my lord.	Yes, just now, my lord.
Cassio, my lord, hath killed a young Venetian Called Roderigo.	Cassio’s killed a young Venetian named Roderigo.
Roderigo killed?	Roderigo’s been killed?
And Cassio killed!	And Cassio’s killed?
No, Cassio is not killed.	No, Cassio wasn’t killed.
Not Cassio killed!	Cassio’s not dead?
Then murder’s out of tune, And sweet revenge grows harsh.	Then the wrong man is dead, and sweet revenge has gone wrong.
Oh, falsely, falsely murdered!	Oh, I’ve been murdered unfairly!
Alas, what cry is that?	Oh Lord, who’s that crying?
That?	That?
What?	What?
Out and alas, that was my lady’s voice.	Oh, no, that was my lady’s voice.
Help!	Help!
Help, ho, help!	Help!
O lady, speak again!	Oh, lady, speak again.
Sweet Desdemona!	Sweet Desdemona!
O sweet mistress, speak!	Oh sweet mistress, speak!
A guiltless death I die.	I’m dying an innocent woman.
Oh, who hath done this deed?	Oh, who did this thing?
Nobody.	No one.
I myself.	I did it myself.
Commend me to my kind lord.	Give my love to my kind husband.
Oh, farewell!	Oh, goodbye!
Why, how should she be murdered?	Why, how could she have been murdered?
Alas, who knows?	My God, who knows?
You heard her say herself it was not I.	You heard her say it wasn’t me.
She said so.	Yes, she said that.
I must needs report the truth.	I must go report what happened.
She’s like a liar gone to burning hell.	She was lying even as she was going down to hell.
Twas I that killed her.	I did kill her.
Oh, the more angel she, And you the blacker devil!	Then she was even more an angel, and you’re an even blacker devil!
She turned to folly, and she was a whore.	She cheated on me, and she was a whore.
Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.	You slander her, you devil.
She was false as water.	She was fickle and unfaithful, like water.
Oh, she was heavenly true!	She was utterly true to you!
Cassio did top her, ask thy husband else.	Ask your husband if you doubt me.
Oh, I were damned beneath all depth in hell, But that I did proceed upon just grounds To this extremity.	If I didn’t have a good reason to do this, damn me to the very bottom of hell.
Thy husband knew it all.	Your husband knew about everything.
My husband!	My husband!
Thy husband.	Your husband.
That she was false to wedlock?	He said she was unfaithful?
Ay, with Cassio.	Yes, with Cassio.
Had she been true, If heaven would make me such another world Of one entire and perfect chrysolite, I’d not have sold her for it.	If she’d been faithful to me, I never would have given her up, not even if God himself offered me a jewel as big as a planet in exchange for her.
My husband?	My husband.
Ay, ’twas he that told me on her first.	Yes, he’s the one who first told me about her.
An honest man he is, and hates the slime That sticks on filthy deeds.	He’s an honest man who detests evil actions.
My husband!	My husband?
What needs this iterance, woman?	Why do you keep repeating that, woman?
I say thy husband.	I’m telling you, your husband.
O mistress, villainy hath made mocks with love!	Oh, my mistress, a villain has made a mockery of your love!
My husband say that she was false!	My husband said she was unfaithful!
He, woman.	Yes, him, woman.
I say “thy husband”—dost understand the word?	I said “your husband.”—Do you understand that word?
My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago.	My friend, your husband, the honest, honest Iago.
If he say so, may his pernicious soul Rot half a grain a day!	If he said that, then I hope his malicious soul rots in hell forever.
He lies to th' heart.	He’s lying through his teeth!
She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.	She was too attached to her filthy marriage ever to do a thing like that!
Ha!	Ha!
Do thy worst.	Go ahead, do your worst.
This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven Than thou wast worthy her.	You weren’t good enough for her.
Peace, you were best.	You’d better shut up!
O gull!	Oh, you idiot!
O dolt!	You stupid fool!
As ignorant as dirt!	As dumb as dirt!
Thou hast done a deed— I care not for thy sword, I’ll make thee known	I’ll tell everyone what you did, even if it
The Moor hath killed my mistress!	The Moor’s killed my mistress!
Murder, murder!	Murder, murder!
What is the matter?	What’s the matter?
How now, general?	What’s going on here, general?
Oh, are you come, Iago?	Oh, are you here, Iago?
You have done well, That men must lay their murders on your neck.	You’ve done a good job, that other men can attribute their murders to you!
What is the matter?	What’s the matter?
I told him what I thought, and told no more Than what he found himself was apt and true.	I told him what I thought.
But did you ever tell him she was false?	But did you tell him she cheated on him?
I did.	I did.
You told a lie, an odious, damnèd lie.	Then you told a lie, a sick, wicked lie.
Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie.	I swear on my soul it was a lie.
She false with Cassio!	You said she slept with Cassio.
Did you say with Cassio?	Did you say Cassio?
With Cassio, mistress.	Yes, with Cassio.
Go to, charm your tongue.	Now be quiet.
My mistress here lies murdered in her bed— Oh, heavens forfend!	My mistress here lies murdered in her bed— No, heaven forbid!
There’s no composition in this news That gives them credit.	You can’t trust them.
Indeed, they are disproportioned.	It’s true, they’re inconsistent.
My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.	My letters say there are a hundred and seven ships.
And mine a hundred and forty.	And mine say a hundred and forty.
And mine, two hundred.	And mine say two hundred.
But though they jump not on a just account— As in these cases, where the aim reports 'Tis oft with difference—yet do they all confirm A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.	But often in these cases, reports are just estimates.
Nay, it is possible enough to judgment.	Yes, we get the idea.
A messenger from the galleys.	It’s a messenger from the warships.
And your reports have set the murder on.	And your lies caused this murder.
I thought so then, I’ll kill myself for grief.	I’ll kill myself out of grief!
Oh, villainy, villainy!	Oh, evil, evil!
What, are you mad?	Are you crazy?
I charge you, get you home.	I’m ordering you, go home.
Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak.	Good gentlemen, give me permission to speak.
Tis proper I obey him, but not now.	I know I ought to obey my husband, but not now.
Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home.	Maybe I’ll never go home again, Iago!
Oh!	Oh!
Oh!	Oh!
Oh!	Oh!
Nay, lay thee down and roar, For thou hast killed the sweetest innocent That e'er did lift up eye.	Yes, go ahead and moan, because you killed the sweetest, most innocent woman who ever lived!
Oh, she was foul!— I scarce did know you, uncle.	She was filthy!
I am glad thy father’s dead, Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief Shore his old thread in twain.	I’m glad your father isn’t alive to see this.
Did he live now,	him terribly.
This sight would make him do a desperate turn, Yea, curse his better angel from his side And fall to reprobation.	It would make him curse the heavens and be damned to hell.
Tis pitiful, but yet Iago knows That she with Cassio hath the act of shame A thousand times committed.	It’s sad, but Iago knows she had sex with Cassio a thousand times.
Zounds, hold your peace.	Damn it, shut your mouth.
Let heaven and men and devils, let them all, All, all cry shame against me, yet I’ll speak.	Let heaven and men and devils tell me to shut me up.
Be wise, and get you home.	If you’re smart, you’ll go home.
I will not.	I won’t.
Fie!	Shame on you!
Your sword upon a woman?	Drawing your sword on a woman?
O thou dull Moor!	Oh, you stupid Moor!
That handkerchief thou speak’st of I found by fortune and did give my husband.	I found that handkerchief by accident and gave it to my husband.
For often, with a solemn earnestness— More than indeed belonged to such a trifle— He begged of me to steal it.	He’d begged me to steal it many times.
Villainous whore!	You evil whore!
She give it Cassio?	You think she gave it to Cassio?
No, alas, I found it And I did give ’t my husband.	No, I found it and gave it to my husband.
Filth, thou liest!	You piece of filth, you’re lying!
By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.—   O murderous coxcomb!	I swear I’m not lying.
Are there no stones in heaven But what serve for the thunder?—Precious villain!	You absolute villain!
Sure he hath killed his wife.	He’s killed his wife!
Ay, ay.	Yes, yes!
Oh, lay me by my mistress' side.	Lay me next to my mistress.
He’s gone, but his wife’s killed.	He’s gone, and his wife’s dead.
Let him not pass, But kill him rather.	Kill him rather than let him leave this room.
But why should honor outlive honesty?	But why should my reputation for honor last longer than my honor did?
Let it go all.	Let it all go.
What did thy song bode, lady?	What did your song mean, lady?
Hark, canst thou hear me?	Can you hear me?
I will play the swan.	I’ll die like a swan.
And die in music.	They sing when they die.
Oh, here it is.	Here it is.
Uncle, I must come forth.	Uncle, I’m coming out!
Look in upon me then and speak with me, Or, naked as I am, I will assault thee.	Look in on me, and talk with me, or I’ll attack even without a weapon.
What is the matter?	What’s the matter?
Behold, I have a weapon.	Look, I have a weapon, the best sword a soldier could have.
That with this little arm and this good sword I have made my way through more impediments Than twenty times your stop.	I’ve fought my way through obstacles twenty times more terrifying than you with this weapon.
But, oh, vain boast!	But
Who can control his fate?	who can control his fate?
tis not so now.	I’m not like that now.
Be not afraid, though you do see me weaponed.	Don’t be afraid, even though you see me with a weapon.
Here is my journey’s end, here is my butt, And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.	This is the end of my journey, the end of my life.
Do you go back dismayed?	Are you backing away in fear?
tis a lost fear.	There’s no reason to be afraid.
Where should Othello go?— Now, how dost thou look now?	Where would Othello go?—Oh, look at you!
O ill-starred wench, Pale as thy smock!	You’re as pale as your nightgown!
When we shall meet at compt This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven And fiends will snatch at it.	When we meet on Judgment Day, that look of yours will send me from heaven to hell, where devils will grab me.
Cold, cold, my girl, Even like thy chastity.	You’re cold, cold, and you were never hot with lust.
O cursed, cursed slave!	Oh you damned villain!
Whip me, ye devils, From the possession of this heavenly sight!	Whip me, you devils, so I don’t have to look at this heavenly sight!
Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?	Where is that poor rash man?
That’s he that was Othello.	You mean the man who used to be Othello?
Here I am.	Here I am.
Where is that viper?	Where’s that snake?
Bring the villain forth.	Bring the villain forward.
I take it much unkindly That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.	I don’t like it that you knew about this, Iago.
Sblood, but you’ll not hear me!	Damn it, you’re not listening to me!
Thou told’st me Thou didst hold him in thy hate.	You told me you hated him.
Despise me If I do not.	I do hate
I look down towards his feet, but that’s a fable.	But that’s just a fairy tale.
If that thou be’st a devil, I cannot kill thee.	If you are a devil, I won’t be able to kill you.
Wrench his sword from him.	Take his sword away from him.
I bleed, sir, but not killed.	I’m bleeding, but you didn’t kill me.
I am not sorry neither.	I’m not sorry, either.
I’d have thee live, For in my sense ’tis happiness to die.	I want you to live, since to me, death is happiness.
Why, anything.	Say anything.
This wretch hath part confessed his villainy.	This poor guy’s partly confessed his plan.
Did you and he consent in Cassio’s death?	Did you plan Cassio’s death with him?
Ay.	Yes.
Dear general, I never gave you cause.	Dear general, I never gave you any reason to hate me.
I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.	I believe you, and I ask you to forgive me.
Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?	Will you please make this half-devil say why he tricked me and damned my soul?
Demand me nothing.	Don’t ask me anything.
What you know, you know.	You know what you know.
From this time forth I never will speak word.	From this moment on, I’ll never say another word.
What, not to pray?	What, not even to pray?
Well, thou dost best.	Well, do your best.
The one of them imports The death of Cassio to be undertook By Roderigo.	This one talks about how Roderigo should kill Cassio.
Oh, villain!	Oh, you villain!
Most heathenish and most gross!	Ungodly and monstrous!
O thou pernicious caitiff!	Oh, you wicked scoundrel!
How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief That was my wife’s?	Cassio, how did you get my wife’s handkerchief?
I found it in my chamber, And he himself confessed but even now That there he dropped it for a special purpose Which wrought to his desire.	I found it in my room, and Iago just confessed that he put it there for his own purposes.
Your power and your command is taken off And Cassio rules in Cyprus.	You’re stripped of your power and your command, and Cassio will govern Cyprus.
For this slave, If there be any cunning cruelty That can torment him much and hold him long, It shall be his.	As for this slave, Iago, if we can think of any torture that will hurt him a lot but keep him alive a long time, he’ll have it.
You shall close prisoner rest Till that the nature of your fault be known To the Venetian state.—Come, bring him away.	You’ll remain a prisoner until we bring your crimes to the Venetian government.—Okay, take him away.
Nothing extenuate, Nor set down aught in malice.	But enough about that.
Then must you speak Of one that loved not wisely, but too well.	When you record these sad events in your letters, please describe me exactly as I am.
Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought, Perplexed in the extreme.	Don’t tone things down or exaggerate them out of hostility.
Of one whose hand, Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away Richer than all his tribe.	If you’re being fair, you’ll have to describe me as someone who loved too much, but who wasn’t wise about it.
Set you down this,	Write all this
And say besides that in Aleppo once, Where a malignant and a turbaned Turk Beat a Venetian and traduced the state, I took by the throat the circumcisèd dog, And smote him, thus.	down, and then say also that in Aleppo I once saw a Turk beating a Venetian, so I grabbed the Turk by the throat and hit him like this.
Oh, bloody period!	Oh, what a bloody end to all this!
All that is spoke is marred.	Everything we’ve heard is bad.
This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon, For he was great of heart.	I was afraid this would happen, because he was a noble, brave man, but I didn’t think he had a weapon.
How say you by this change?	What do you think about this change?
This cannot be, By no assay of reason.	They can’t have changed; there’s no way this could be true.
Tis a pageant, To keep us in false gaze.	It’s a trick to confuse us.
Here is more news.	Here’s some more news coming in.
Ay, so I thought.	That’s just what I thought.
How many, as you guess?	How many, can you guess?
Of thirty sail.	Thirty ships.
And now they do re-stem Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance Their purposes toward Cyprus.	Now they’ve turned around and are clearly heading for Cyprus.
Signior Montano, Your trusty and most valiant servitor, With his free duty recommends you thus, And prays you to believe him.	Signor Montano, your brave and loyal servant, gives you this information and asks you to send reinforcements to relieve him.
Tis certain then for Cyprus.	Then it’s certain they’re heading for Cyprus.
Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town?	Is Marcus Luccicos in town?
He’s now in Florence.	No, he’s in Florence.
Write from us to him.	Write to him immediately.
Post-post-haste, dispatch.	Hurry.
Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.	Here come Brabantio and the brave Moor.
Good your grace, pardon me.	Forgive me, your grace.
Why, what’s the matter?	Why, what’s the matter?
My daughter!	It’s my daughter!
Oh, my daughter!	Oh, my daughter!
Dead?	Is she dead?
Ay, to me.	She’s dead to me.
Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself And you of her, the bloody book of law You shall yourself read in the bitter letter, After your own sense, yea, though our proper son Stood in your action.	And you yourself will determine the sentence as you see fit, and impose the death penalty if you choose to, even if the criminal were my own son.
Humbly I thank your grace.	I humbly thank you, sir.
We are very sorry for’t.	We’re sorry to hear this.
Nothing, but this is so.	Nothing, but this is true.
The very head and front of my offending Hath this extent, no more.	There’s nothing more.
More than pertains to feats of broils and battle, And therefore little shall I grace my cause In speaking for myself.	I’m awkward in my speech and I’m not a smooth talker.
A maiden never bold, Of spirit so still and quiet that her motion Blushed at herself.	She blushes at the slightest thing.
Against all rules of nature, and must be driven To find out practices of cunning hell Why this should be.	The devil must be behind this.
I therefore vouch again That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood Or with some dram, conjured to this effect, He wrought upon her.	Therefore I say again that he must have used some powerful drug or magic potion on her.
But, Othello, speak.	Tell us, Othello.
Or came it by request and such fair question As soul to soul affordeth?	Or did you agree to this as equals?
And let her speak of me before her father.	of her father.
Fetch Desdemona hither.	Bring Desdemona here.
You best know the place.	You know where she is.
And till she come, as truly as to heaven I do confess the vices of my blood So justly to your grave ears I’ll present How I did thrive in this fair lady’s love And she in mine.	In the meantime I’ll tell you all, as honestly as I confess my sins to God, how I wooed this beautiful lady, and how she came to love me.
Say it, Othello.	Tell us, Othello.
Her father loved me, oft invited me, Still questioned me the story of my life From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes, That I have passed.	Her father loved me and used to invite me to his house often, continually asking me about my life and all the battles I’ve fought.
These things to hear Would Desdemona seriously incline.	When I talked about all these things, Desdemona used to listen attentively.
She wished she had not heard it, yet she wished That heaven had made her such a man.	She said she wished she hadn’t heard it, but she also wished there was a man like me for her.
She thanked me And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her, I should but teach him how to tell my story And that would woo her.	She thanked me and told me that if a friend of mine had a story like mine to tell, she’d fall in love with him.
Upon this hint I spake.	I took the hint and spoke to her.
She loved me for the dangers I had passed, And I loved her that she did pity them.	She said she loved me for the dangers I’d survived, and I loved her for feeling such strong emotions about me.
This only is the witchcraft I have used.	That’s the only witchcraft I ever used.
Here comes the lady.	Here comes my wife now.
Let her witness it.	She’ll confirm everything.
I think this tale would win my daughter too.	I think a story like that would win my own daughter over.
I pray you, hear her speak.	Please let her speak.
If she confess that she was half the wooer, Destruction on my head if my bad blame Light on the man.—Come hither, gentle mistress.	If she admits she wanted this, then I won’t blame Othello.—Come here, my child.
Do you perceive in all this noble company Where most you owe obedience?	Who do you obey here?
My noble father, I do perceive here a divided duty.	Father, this isn’t easy for me.
To you I am bound for life and education.	I’m torn.
You are the lord of duty.	You’re the one I have to obey.
I am hitherto your daughter.	I’m your daughter.
I have done.	I’m finished, then.
Please it your grace, on to the state affairs.	Duke, please go ahead with your state business.
I had rather to adopt a child than get it.— Come hither, Moor.	I’d rather adopt a child than have one of my own.—Come here, Moor.
I here do give thee that with all my heart Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart I would keep from thee.	With all my heart, I give you that thing which, if you didn’t already have it, I’d try with all my heart to keep from you.
For thy escape would teach me tyranny, To hang clogs on them.—I have done, my lord.	You would have made me treat them like a tyrant.—I’m done, my lord.
Let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers.	Let me refer to a proverb that may help you forgive these lovers: if you can’t change something, don’t cry about it.
I humbly beseech you, proceed to th' affairs of state.	Please, I’m asking you, go ahead and get back to your state affairs.
The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus.	The Turks are heading for Cyprus with a powerful fleet.
Why, at her father’s.	She can stay at her father’s house.
I’ll not have it so.	I won’t allow it.
Nor I.	Neither will I.
Most gracious Duke, To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear And let me find a charter in your voice, T' assist my simpleness.	Dear Duke, please listen to what I have to say.
What would you, Desdemona?	What do you want to do, Desdemona?
That I did love the Moor to live with him, My downright violence and storm of fortunes May trumpet to the world.	When I fell in love with Othello I made up my mind that I wanted to live with him.
I saw Othello’s visage in his mind, And to his honors and his valiant parts Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.	I saw Othello’s true face when I saw his mind.
Let me go with him.	Let me go with him.
Let her have your voice.	Please allow her to do this.
Be it as you shall privately determine, Either for her stay or going.	You can decide that privately.
Th' affair cries haste And speed must answer it.	What’s important is the urgency of this mission.
You must away tonight.	You’ll have to leave tonight.
With all my heart.	With all my heart, I’ll go right away.
At nine i' th' morning here we’ll meet again.	We’ll meet again at nine in the morning.
Othello, leave some officer behind And he shall our commission bring to you, And such things else of quality and respect As doth import you.	Othello, have one of your officers stay behind to bring you your commission and whatever else is important to you.
To his conveyance I assign my wife, With what else needful your good grace shall think To be sent after me.	He’ll accompany my wife, and bring whatever else you think I might need.
Wherein the toged consuls can propose As masterly as he.	which any peace-lover can do.
Mere prattle without practice Is all his soldiership.	His military understanding is all theory, no practice.
Why, there’s no remedy.	And there’s nothing I can do about it.
Tis the curse of service.	That’s the curse of military service.
Now sir, be judge yourself, Whether I in any just term am affined To love the Moor.	Now, you tell me: should I feel loyal to the Moor?
I would not follow him then.	If you don’t like him you should quit.
O sir, content you.	No, calm down.
I follow him to serve my turn upon him.	I’m serving under him to take advantage of him.
We cannot all be masters, nor all masters Cannot be truly followed.	We can’t all be masters, and not all masters should be followed.
You shall mark Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave That (doting on his own obsequious bondage) Wears out his time much like his master’s ass For naught but provender, and when he’s old, cashiered.	Look at all the devoted servants who work for their masters their whole lives for nothing but their food, and then when they get old they’re terminated.
Whip me such honest knaves.	They ought to be whipped for being so stupid.
These fellows have some soul,	Let me tell
Let it be so.	All right, then.
Use Desdemona well.	Treat Desdemona well.
Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see.	Keep an eye on her, Moor.
She has deceived her father, and may thee.	She lied to me, and she may lie to you.
My life upon her faith!—Honest Iago, My Desdemona must I leave to thee.	Iago, I’m leaving my dear Desdemona with you.
I prithee, let thy wife attend on her, And bring them after in the best advantage.	Have your wife attend to her, and bring them along as soon as you can.
Come, Desdemona, I have but an hour Of love, of worldly matter and direction, To spend with thee.	Come on, Desdemona, I’ve only got an hour of love to spend with you, to tell you what you need to do.
We must obey the time.	We’re on a tight schedule.
Iago.	Iago.
What say’st thou, noble heart?	What do you have to say, noble friend?
What will I do, think’st thou?	What do you think I should do?
Why, go to bed, and sleep.	Go to bed, and sleep.
I will incontinently drown myself.	I’m going to go drown myself.
If thou dost I shall never love thee after.	If you do that, I’ll never respect you again.
Why, thou silly gentleman!	Why, you silly man!
Oh, villainous!	Oh, how stupid!
I have looked upon the world for four times seven years, and since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury I never found man that knew how to love himself.	I’ve been alive for twenty-eight years, and I’ve never met a man who knew what was good for him.
Ere I would say I would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen, I would change my humanity with a baboon.	I’d rather be a baboon than kill myself out of love for some woman I can’t have.
What should I do?	What should I do?
I confess it is my shame to be so fond, but it is not in my virtue to amend it.	I know it’s foolish to be so much in love, but I can’t help it.
Virtue?	Can’t help it?
A fig!	Nonsense!
Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus.	What we are is up to us.
Our bodies are our gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners.	Our bodies are like gardens and our willpower is like the gardener.
So that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many—either to have it sterile with idleness, or manured with industry—why, the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills.	Depending on what we plant—weeds or lettuce, or one kind of herb rather than a variety, the garden will either be barren and useless, or rich and productive.
If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most prepost'rous conclusions.	If we didn’t have rational minds to counterbalance our emotions and desires, our bodily urges would take over.
But we have reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts.	Thankfully, we have reason to cool our raging lusts.
It cannot be.	I don’t believe it.
It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will.	You feel love because you feel lust and you have no willpower.
Come, be a man.	Come on, be a man.
Drown thyself?	Drown yourself?
Drown cats and blind puppies!	Drowning is for cats or blind puppies—don’t drown yourself!
I have professed me thy friend, and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness.	I’ve told you I’m your friend, and I’ll stick by you.
I could never better stead thee than now.	I’ve never been more useful to you than I will be now.
Put money in thy purse.	Here’s what you’ll do.
These Moors are changeable in their wills—fill thy purse with money.	Moors are moody people.—So sell your lands and raise a lot of cash.
The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida.	What seems sweet to him now will soon turn bitter.
She must change for youth.	She’ll have to have it.
Therefore, put money in thy purse.	So have your money ready.
If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate way than drowning.	If you want to go to hell, there are better ways to do it than killing yourself.
Make all the money thou canst.	Raise all the money you can.
If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou shalt enjoy her.	I can get the better of religion and a few flimsy vows between a misguided barbarian and a depraved Venetian girl.
A pox of drowning thyself!	And to hell with drowning yourself!
Tis clean out of the way.	That’s completely beside the point.
Thou art sure of me.	You can trust me.
Go, make money.	Go now and get cash.
I have told thee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I hate the Moor.	I told you before, and I’ll tell you again and again: I hate the Moor.
Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him.	So let’s join forces and get revenge.
Traverse, go, provide thy money.	Go get money.
We will have more of this tomorrow.	We’ll speak again tomorrow.
Adieu.	Goodbye.
Where shall we meet i' th' morning?	Where will we meet in the morning?
At my lodging.	At my house.
I’ll be with thee betimes.	I’ll be there early.
No more of drowning, do you hear?	No more talk about killing yourself, okay?
I am changed.	I’ve changed my mind about that.
Go to, farewell.	Go then, goodbye.
Put money enough in your purse.	Put a lot of cash together.
I’ll sell all my land.	I’m going to sell all my land.
Thus do I ever make my fool my purse.	That’s how I always do it, getting money from fools.
For I mine own gained knowledge should profane If I would time expend with such a snipe But for my sport and profit.	I’d be wasting my skills dealing with an idiot like that if I couldn’t get something useful out of him.
I hate the Moor, And it is thought abroad that ’twixt my sheets He’s done my office.	I hate the Moor, and there’s a widespread rumor that he’s slept with my wife.
I know not if ’t be true, But I, for mere suspicion in that kind, Will do as if for surety.	I’m not sure it’s true, but just the suspicion is enough for me.
He holds me well.	He thinks highly of me.
Cassio’s a proper man.	Cassio’s a handsome man.
Let me see now,	Let’s see, how can I
To get his place and to plume up my will In double knavery.	get his position and use him to hurt Othello at the same time?
How?	How?
How?	How?
Let’s see.	Let’s see.
I have ’t.	I’ve worked it out.
What from the cape can you discern at sea?	What can you see out on the ocean?
Nothing at all.	Nothing.
It is a high-wrought flood.	It was windy on shore too.
Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land, A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements.	A big blast of wind shook our fortifications.
What shall we hear of this?	What do you think will be the result of this storm?
A segregation of the Turkish fleet.	The Turkish navy will be broken up.
For do but stand upon the foaming shore, The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds, The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane, Seems to cast water on the burning bear, And quench the guards of th' ever-fixèd pole.	The wind’s whipping up the waves so high you expect them to reach the clouds and splash against the stars in the sky.
I never did like molestation view On the enchafèd flood.	I’ve never seen the waters so disturbed.
If that the Turkish fleet Be not ensheltered and embayed, they are drowned.	If the Turkish fleet isn’t protected in some harbor, their men must all be drowned.
It is impossible they bear it out.	No ship could survive this storm.
News, lads, Our wars are done!	I’ve got news, boys, the war’s over!
The desperate tempest hath so banged the Turks, That their designment halts.	This terrible storm has smashed the Turks so badly that their plans are ruined.
A noble ship of Venice Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance On most part of their fleet.	One of our ships has reported that it saw most of their fleet shipwrecked.
How?	What?
Is this true?	Is this true?
Michael Cassio, Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello, Is come on shore.	Michael Cassio, lieutenant of the Moor Othello, has arrived on shore.
The Moor himself at sea And is in full commission here for Cyprus.	The Moor himself is still at sea.
I am glad on ’t.	I’m happy about that.
Tis a worthy governor.	He’ll be a good governor.
For they were parted With foul and violent tempest.	The two of them were separated during the storm.
Pray heavens he be, For I have served him, and the man commands Like a full soldier.	I hope to God Othello’s all right.
Come, let’s do so.	Let’s do that.
For every minute is expectancy Of more arrivance.	Every minute we expect more ships to arrive.
Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle That so approve the Moor.	Thanks, you brave men who defend this island and respect Othello.
Oh, let the heavens Give him defense against the elements, For I have lost him on a dangerous sea.	I hope heaven protects him from the weather, because I lost sight of him on the stormy sea.
Is he well shipped?	Is his ship sturdy?
His bark is stoutly timbered and his pilot Of very expert and approved allowance Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death, Stand in bold cure.	Yes, it’s well built, and the ship’s pilot is very expert and experienced.
What noise?	What’s all that shouting about?
I pray you sir, go forth And give us truth who ’tis that is arrived.	Please go find out for certain who has arrived.
I shall.	I’ll do that.
But good lieutenant, is your general wived?	Good lieutenant, is your general married?
Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.	A man named Iago, the general’s ensign.
What is she?	Who’s that?
Oh, behold, The riches of the ship is come on shore!	Look, the precious Desdemona has arrived on shore.
You men of Cyprus, let her have your knees.	We should all kneel before her, men of Cyprus!
Hail to thee, lady, and the grace of heaven, Before, behind thee, and on every hand, Enwheel thee round!	Greetings, my lady, and may God always be with you.
I thank you, valiant Cassio.	Thank you, brave Cassio.
What tidings can you tell me of my lord?	Is there any news about my husband?
He is not yet arrived.	He hasn’t arrived yet.
Nor know I aught But that he’s well and will be shortly here.	As far as I know, he’s okay and will arrive here soon.
Oh, but I fear.	Oh, but I’m worried.
How lost you company?	How did you two get separated?
The great contention of the sea and skies Parted our fellowship—   But, hark!	The storm separated us.
See for the news.	Go find out the news.
For, sir, It is as sure as you are Roderigo, Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago.	you, as sure as your name’s Roderigo, if I were the Moor I wouldn’t want to be Iago.
I am not what I am.	I’m not who I appear to be.
Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell As when, by night and negligence, the fire Is spied in populous cities.	Do it, and shout like the city’s on fire.
What, ho, Brabantio!	Hey, Brabantio!
Signior Brabantio, ho!	Signor Brabantio, hey!
Thieves!	Thieves!
Thieves!	Thieves!
Look to your house, your daughter, and your bags!	Check on your daughter, your house, your money!
Thieves!	Thieves!
thieves!	Thieves!
Sir, would she give you so much of her lips As of her tongue she oft bestows on me, You’ll have enough.	If she gave you as much lip as she gives me, you’d be sick of her by now.
I find it still, when I have leave to sleep.	She’s always talking when I want to sleep.
Marry, before your ladyship, I grant, She puts her tongue a little in her heart And chides with thinking.	I admit that in front of you, my lady, she keeps a bit quiet.
You have little cause to say so.	You have no reason to say that.
Come on, come on.	Come on, come on.
You are pictures out of door, bells in your parlors, wild-cats in your kitchens, saints in your injuries, devils being offended, players in your housewifery, and housewives in your beds.	In your own kitchens you act like wildcats.
Oh, fie upon thee, slanderer!	Shame on you, you slanderer!
Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk.	No, it’s true, or if it’s not, I’m a villain.
You rise to play and go to bed to work.	You wake up to have fun, and you start work when you go to bed.
No, let me not.	No, I don’t.
What wouldst thou write of me, if thou should’st praise me?	But if you had to say something nice about me, what would you say?
O gentle lady, do not put me to ’t, For I am nothing, if not critical.	Don’t make me do it, my lady.
Come on, assay.	I’m critical by nature.
Ay, madam.	Yes, madam.
I am not merry, but I do beguile The thing I am by seeming otherwise.	I’m not as happy as I seem.
Come, how wouldst thou praise me?	Come on, what would you say about me?
Well praised!	Very clever!
If she be black, and thereto have a wit, She’ll find a white that shall her blackness fit.	Even if she’s ugly, she’ll be smart enough to find a guy to sleep with her.
Worse and worse!	This is getting worse and worse!
How if fair and foolish?	What if she’s pretty but stupid?
Oh, heavy ignorance!	You don’t know a thing!
Thou praisest the worst best.	You give your best praise to the worst women.
But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed, one that in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself?	But how would you praise a truly good woman, someone who had no reason to worry about what anyone said about her?
She that was ever fair and never proud, Had tongue at will and yet was never loud, Never lacked gold and yet went never gay, Fled from her wish and yet said “Now I may,” She that being angered, her revenge being nigh, Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly, She that in wisdom never was so frail To change the cod’s head for the salmon’s tail, She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind, See suitors following and not look behind, She was a wight, if ever such wights were— To do what?	A woman who was beautiful but never proud, who could speak well but knew when to be quiet, who dressed well but was never overdressed, who had self-restraint even when she could get what she wanted, a woman who never took revenge, who overlooked it when people hurt her, who was too wise to do anything stupid, who could think without revealing her thoughts, and who could refrain from flirting with men in love with her, that kind of woman, if she ever existed, would— Would do what?
To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.	Would raise babies and clip coupons.
Oh, most lame and impotent conclusion!	Oh, that’s pathetic!
Do not learn of him, Emilia, though he be thy husband.	Don’t listen to him, Emilia, even though he’s your husband.
How say you, Cassio?	What do you think about him, Cassio?
Is he not a most profane and liberal counselor?	Isn’t he a horrible man?
He speaks home, madam.	He speaks bluntly, madam.
You may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar.	He’s more of a soldier than a wise man.
I know his trumpet.	I recognize his trumpet.
Tis truly so.	Yes, it is.
Let’s meet him and receive him.	Let’s go greet him when he lands.
Lo, where he comes!	Look, here he comes.
Oh my fair warrior!	My beautiful warrior!
My dear Othello!	My darling Othello!
It gives me wonder great as my content To see you here before me.	I’m amazed you got here before me.
Oh, my soul’s joy!	But I’m overjoyed!
If it were now to die, 'Twere now to be most happy, for I fear My soul hath her content so absolute That not another comfort like to this Succeeds in unknown fate.	If I died right now I’d be completely happy, since I’ll probably never be as happy as this again in my life.
The heavens forbid But that our loves and comforts should increase, Even as our days do grow.	God willing, our love and our happiness will only increase as we get older.
Amen to that, sweet powers!	Amen to that!
I cannot speak enough of this content.	I can’t talk about my happiness anymore.
It stops me here, it is too much of joy.	It’s too much.
Come, let us to the castle.	Let’s go up to the castle.
News, friends!	Good news, friends.
Our wars are done, the Turks are drowned.	The war’s over and the Turks are drowned.
How does my old acquaintance of this isle?— Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus, I have found great love amongst them.	How are my old friends from this island doing?—Honey, they’ll love you here in Cyprus.
Bring thou the master to the citadel.	And bring the ship’s captain to the castle.
He is a good one, and his worthiness Does challenge much respect.—Come, Desdemona, Once more, well met at Cyprus.	He’s a good man.—Let’s go, Desdemona.
Do thou meet me presently at the harbor.—Come hither.	Meet me down at the harbor.—Come here.
The lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard.	Lieutenant Cassio will be on guard duty tonight.
First, I must tell thee this: Desdemona is directly in love with him.	But first, I have to tell you that Desdemona’s completely in love with him.
With him?	With Cassio?
Why, ’tis not possible.	That’s impossible.
Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.	Be quiet and listen to me.
All which the Moor is defective in.	Othello isn’t any of those things.
Now sir, this granted—as it is a most pregnant and unforced position—who stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does?	Now, if that’s true—and it’s obviously true—who’s in a better position than Cassio?
Besides, the knave is handsome, young, and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after.	Besides, he’s young and handsome, and he’s got all the qualities that naïve and silly girls go for.
I cannot believe that in her.	I can’t believe that.
She’s full of most blessed condition.	She’s very moral.
The wine she drinks is made of grapes.	Like hell she is!
If she had been blessed, she would never have loved the Moor.	If she were so moral, she would never have fallen in love with the Moor in the first place.
Blessed pudding!	Good lord!
Didst not mark that?	Did you see that?
They met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together.	They were lusting after each other.
Pish!	Disgusting!
But, sir, be you ruled by me.	But listen to me; let me guide you.
I have brought you from Venice.	I brought you here from Venice.
Watch you tonight for the command, I’ll lay ’t upon you.	Be on guard duty tonight.
Cassio knows you not.	Cassio doesn’t know you.
I’ll not be far from you.	I’ll be nearby.
Do you find some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or tainting his discipline, or from what other course you please, which the time shall more favorably minister.	Make Cassio angry somehow, either by speaking too loud, or insulting his military skills, or however else you want.
Well.	All right.
Sir, he’s rash and very sudden in choler, and haply may strike at you.	He’s hot-tempered, and he might try to hit you with his staff.
Provoke him that he may.	Try to get him to do that.
For even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny, whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio.	To get what you want, you need to get Cassio out of the way.
I will do this, if you can bring it to any opportunity.	I’ll do it, if you help me out.
I warrant thee.	I promise I will.
Meet me by and by at the citadel.	Meet me in a little while at the citadel.
I must fetch his necessaries ashore.	I need to get Othello’s things from the ship.
Farewell.	Goodbye.
Adieu.	Goodbye.
The thought whereof Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards, And nothing can or shall content my soul Till I am evened with him, wife for wife.	I won’t be satisfied until I get even with him, wife for wife.
Or, failing so, yet that I put the Moor At least into a jealousy so strong That judgment cannot cure.	If I can’t do that, I can at least make the Moor so jealous that he can’t think straight.
For besides these beneficial news, it is the celebration of his nuptial.	For besides the good news, we are also celebrating his marriage.
So much was his pleasure should be proclaimed.	That’s the end of the announcement.
All offices are open, and there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five till the bell have told eleven.	There will be a feast from five o'clock until eleven.
Bless the isle of Cyprus and our noble general Othello!	God bless the island of Cyprus and our noble general Othello!
Iago is most honest.	Iago’s a good man.
Michael, good night.	Goodnight, Michael.
Tomorrow with your earliest Let me have speech with you.— Come, my dear love, The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue: That profit’s yet to come ’tween me and you.	Come talk to me tomorrow as early as you can.—Come with me, my dear love.
Good night.	Good night, everyone.
Welcome, Iago.	Hello, Iago.
We must to the watch.	It’s time for us to stand guard.
Our general cast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona—who let us not therefore blame.	The general got rid of us early tonight so he could be with Desdemona.—I can’t blame him.
What is the reason of this terrible summons?	What’s the reason for this horrible shouting?
What is the matter there?	What’s the matter?
Signior, is all your family within?	Sir, is everyone in your family at home?
Are your doors locked?	Are your doors locked?
Why, wherefore ask you this?	Why are you asking me that?
Zounds, sir, you’re robbed!	For God’s sake, sir, you’ve been robbed.
For shame, put on your gown.	Your heart’s going to break.
Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul.	It’s like half your soul’s been ripped out.
Even now, now, very now, an old black ram Is tupping your white ewe.	At this very minute an old black ram is having sex with your little white lamb.
Arise, arise, Awake the snorting citizens with the bell Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you.	Wake up, wake up, ring a bell and wake up all the snoring citizens.
Arise, I say!	Get up, I tell you!
What, have you lost your wits?	Are you crazy?
Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?	Do you recognize my voice, noble lord?
Not I.	Not me.
What are you?	Who are you?
My name is Roderigo.	My name’s Roderigo.
I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors.	I told you not to hang around my house.
In honest plainness thou hast heard me say My daughter is not for thee.	I’ve already told you quite plainly that my daughter will never marry you.
Sir, sir, sir—	Sir, sir, sir—
Indeed she’s a most fresh and delicate creature.	Yes, she’s young and tender.
What an eye she has!	Like an invitation.
An inviting eye, and yet methinks right modest.	But she’s modest and ladylike too.
And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?	And when she speaks, doesn’t her voice stir up passion?
She is indeed perfection.	She’s a perfect woman, it’s true.
Well, happiness to their sheets!	Well, good luck to them tonight in bed!
Not tonight, good Iago.	Not tonight, Iago.
I have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking.	I’m not much of a drinker.
I could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment.	I wish there was less social pressure to drink.
Oh, they are our friends.	Oh, but these are our friends.
But one cup.	Just one glass.
I’ll drink for you.	I’ll do most of the drinking for you.
I have drunk but one cup tonight, and that was craftily qualified too, and behold what innovation it makes here.	I’ve already had a glass of wine tonight, watered down, but look how drunk I am.
What, man, ’tis a night of revels!	What are you talking about, man?
The gallants desire it.	Tonight is for celebrating!
Where are they?	Where are they?
Here at the door.	By the door.
I pray you call them in.	Please invite them in.
I’ll do ’t, but it dislikes me.	I’ll do it, but I don’t like it.
If I can fasten but one cup upon him, With that which he hath drunk tonight already, He’ll be as full of quarrel and offense As my young mistress' dog.	If I can just get him to drink one more glass after what he’s drunk already, he’ll be as argumentative and eager to fight as a little dog.
Now ’mongst this flock of drunkards Am I to put our Cassio in some action That may offend the isle.	Now I’ll get Cassio to do something in front of all these drunkards that will offend everyone on the island.
But here they come.	Here they come.
If consequence do but approve my dream My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.	If the future turns out as I hope it will, I’m all set for success.
Fore heaven, they have given me a rouse already.	My God, they’ve given me a lot to drink.
Good faith, a little one, not past a pint, As I am a soldier.	No, it was a little one, not more than a pint.
Some wine, ho!	Bring in more wine!
Fore heaven, an excellent song.	My God, what a great song!
I learned it in England where indeed they are most potent in potting.	I learned it in England, where they have a talent for drinking.
Your Dane, your German, and your swag-bellied Hollander—Drink, ho!—are nothing to your English.	The Danes, the Germans, and the Dutch—come on, drink, drink!—are nothing compared to the English.
Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?	Are Englishmen really such heavy drinkers?
Why, he drinks you with facility your Dane dead drunk; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain.	They drink Danes under the table, and it takes them no effort at all to out-drink Germans.
To the health of our general!	Let’s drink to our general!
I am for it, lieutenant, and I’ll do you justice.	I’ll drink as much as you do!
Oh, sweet England!	Oh, sweet England!
Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other.	God, that song’s even better than the other one.
Will you hear ’t again?	Do you want to hear it again?
No, for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things.	No, because we shouldn’t be doing that—stuff.
Well, heaven’s above all, and there be souls must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved.	Oh well, God’s in charge, and some people have to go to heaven, while other people have to go to hell.
It’s true, good lieutenant.	That’s true, lieutenant.
For mine own part, no offence to the general nor any man of quality, I hope to be saved.	Speaking for myself—and no offense to the general or anyone else—I hope I’m going to heaven.
And so do I too, lieutenant.	Me too, lieutenant.
Ay, but (by your leave) not before me.	Okay, but please not before me.
The lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient.	The lieutenant has to get to heaven before the ensign.
Let’s have no more of this, let’s to our affairs.—Forgive us our sins!—Gentlemen, let’s look to our business.	But let’s stop this drinking and get down to business.—God forgive our sins!—Gentlemen, let’s get down to business.
Do not think, gentlemen, I am drunk.	By the way, I don’t want anyone thinking I’m drunk.
I am not drunk now.	I’m not drunk.
I can stand well enough, and I speak well enough.	I can stand well enough, and I can speak just fine.
Excellent well!	Yes, you’re speaking very well.
Why, very well then.	Yes, very well.
You must not think then that I am drunk.	So don’t think that I’m drunk.
Tis pity of him.	It’s too bad.
But is he often thus?	But is he often like this?
Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep.	He drinks like this every night before he goes to sleep.
He’ll watch the horologe a double set If drink rock not his cradle.	He’d stay up all night and all day if he didn’t drink himself to sleep.
It were well The general were put in mind of it.	The general should be informed about this.
Is not this true?	Don’t you think so?
And ’tis great pity that the noble Moor Should hazard such a place as his own second With one of an ingraft infirmity.	And it’s too bad that the Moor chose a man with such a deep-rooted drinking problem as his second-in-command.
It were an honest action to say So to the Moor.	We should definitely say something to the Moor.
Tush, never tell me!	Rubbish!
I take it much unkindly That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.	Don’t tell me; I don’t like it at all That you, Iago, who has used my purse As if the strings were yours, should know about this.
Sblood, but you will not hear me.	but you’re not listening to me.
If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.	If I ever dreamt about such a matter, Hate me.
Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.	You told me you hated him.
Despise me, if I do not.	Despise me, if I don’t.
Forsooth, a great arithmetician, One Michael Cassio, a Florentine A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife That never set a squadron in the field, Nor the division of a battle knows More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric, Where in the toga'd consuls can propose As masterly as he; mere prattle without practice, Is all his soldiership.	Truly, a great arithmetician, One Michael Cassio, a Florentine, A fellow almost damned in a having a beautiful wife; That has never led a squadron in the field, And doesn’t know the division of a battle any More than a spinster does, unless the theory books, In which the consuls wearing togas can propose a plan As masterly as he can.
By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.	By heaven, I would rather have been his hangman.
Why, there's no remedy.	Why, there's no remedy; it is the curse of the military.
Tis the curse of service, Preferment goes by letter and affection, And not by old gradation, where each second Stood heir to the first.	Preference goes by who you know and who likes you, And not by old system, where each second person Took the first’s place.
Now, sir, be judge yourself Whether I in any just term am affined To love the Moor.	Now, sir, judge it for yourself Whether or I am better suited in any beautiful terms To love the Moor.
I would not follow him then.	I wouldn’t follow him then.
You shall mark Many a duteous and kneecrooking knave, That doting on his own obsequious bondage Wears out his time, much like his master's ass, For naught but provender; and, when he's old, cashier'd.	You shall see Many a duteous and knee-bending rogue That, doting on his own obedient slavery, Wears himself out, much like his master's ass, For nothing but dry oats; and when he's old, dismissed From the service.
Whip me such honest knaves.	I would whip such honest rogues.
Others there are, Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty, Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves, And throwing but shows of service on their lords Do well thrive by them; and when they have lined their coats Do themselves homage.	There are others who, dressed in uniforms and faces of duty, that keep their hearts attending on themselves; And, throwing only shows of service to their lords, Thrive well by them, and when they have lined their coats, Do themselves homage.
These fellows have some soul, And such a one do I profess myself.	These fellows have some soul; And someone like that is how I am.
For, sir, It is as sure as you are Roderigo, Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago.	Because, sir, It is as sure as you are Roderigo, Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago.
What a full fortune does the thicklips owe, If he can carry't thus!	What great luck the thick lips have, If he can get away with this!
Though that his joy be joy, Yet throw such changes of vexation on't As it may lose some color.	even if his joy is joy, Still throw such aggravation on it That he won’t stay happy for long.
Do; with like timorous accent and dire yell As when, by night and negligence, the fire Is spied in populous cities.	Go ahead; yell with frightening accent and distress As when a fire Is seen in big cities at night and by accident.

Because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse; you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have coursers for cousins, and gennets for germans.	Because we are servants, and you think we are ruffians, you'd have your daughter covered with a African horse; you'd have your nephews neigh to you; you'd have chargers for cousins and small Spanish horses for Germans.

It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place, To be produced—as, if I stay, I shall— Against the Moor.	It doesn’t seem right or suitable to my position To be a witness (which I will be if I stay), Against the Moor.
For I do know, the state, However this may gall him with some check, Cannot with safety cast him; for he's embark'd With such loud reason to the Cyprus' wars, Which even now stands in act, that, for their souls, Another of his fathom they have none To lead their business; in which regard, Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains, Yet for necessity of present life, I must show out a flag and sign of love, Which is indeed but sign.	because I know the government, No matter how angry this makes Brabantio with some Argument, cannot arrest him safely; because he's Embarked with such loud reason to the Cyprus wars, Which is being discussed even now, that, to save their Souls, they have no one of his depth To lead their armies, in which regard, Although I hate him as I hate hell pains, I must still show a flag and sign of love, To preserve my present life, Which is indeed only sign.

I will not rise unless your Highness hear me.	I will not rise until your Highness hears me.
Then say at once what is it thou requests.	Then hurry up and tell me what you want.
The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant’s life, Who slew today a riotous gentleman Lately attendant on the duke of Norfolk.	That you lift the death sentence on my servant, who killed a rowdy and belligerent former servant of the duke of Norfolk.
We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.	We know you have a job to do, Brakenbury, and we’ll do what you say.
We are the queen’s abjects and must obey.— Brother, farewell.	Farewell, brother.
I know it pleaseth neither of us well.	It doesn’t make either of us happy, I know.
Well, your imprisonment shall not be long.	Well, your imprisonment won’t last long.
I will deliver you or else lie for you.	I will either get you out, lying if I have to, or stay in prison in your place.
Meantime, have patience.	In the meantime, be patient.
I must perforce.	I have no choice.
Farewell.	Goodbye.
Go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.	Go walk the path that you will never return from.
Simple, plain Clarence, I do love thee so That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven, If heaven will take the present at our hands.	I love you so much that I’ll send your soul to heaven very soon—if heaven will accept anything from me, that is.
But who comes here?	But who’s coming?
Good time of day unto my gracious lord.	Good afternoon, my dear lord!
As much unto my good Lord Chamberlain.	The same to you, my lord!
Well are you welcome to the open air.	Welcome to the open air again.
How hath your lordship brooked imprisonment?	How did you tolerate prison?
My brother killed no man; his fault was thought, And yet his punishment was bitter death.	But his punishment was bitter death.
Who sued to me for him?	Who pleaded with me to pardon
This is the fruits of rashness.	This is what happens when you act rashly.
Marked you not How that the guilty kindred of the queen Looked pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?	Did you notice how the queen’s guilty relatives turned pale when they heard about Clarence’s death?
O, they did urge it still unto the king.	Oh, they continually urged the king to do it.
God will revenge it.	God will revenge it.
Come, lords, will you go To comfort Edward with our company?	But come, lords, will you come with me to Edward’s room to comfort him?
We wait upon your Grace.	We’ll come with you, your Grace.
Good grandam, tell us, is our father dead?	Tell me, good grandmother, is our father dead?
No, boy.	No, boy.
My pretty cousins, you mistake me both.	My pretty children, both of you misunderstand me.
Then, you conclude, my grandam, he is dead.	So you’re admitting Clarence, my father, is dead.
The king mine uncle is to blame for it.	My uncle the king is to blame for this.
God will revenge it, whom I will importune With earnest prayers, all to that effect.	God will take revenge.
And so will I.	And so will I.
Peace, children, peace.	Quiet, children, quiet.
The king doth love you well.	The king loves you very much.
Incapable and shallow innocents, You cannot guess who caused your father’s death.	Innocent sweethearts, you have no idea who’s responsible for your father’s death.
Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?	You think my uncle was lying, grandmother?
Ay, boy.	Yes, boy.
I cannot think it.	I can’t believe that.
Hark, what noise is this?	What’s that noise?
I’ll join with black despair against my soul And to myself become an enemy.	I plan to fall into the blackest despair.
Why grow the branches when the root is gone?	Why are the branches still living when the root is gone?
Why wither not the leaves that want their sap?	Why aren’t the leaves withering now that the sap is all dried up?
If you will live, lament.	If you do intend to live, then mourn.
If die, be brief, That our swift-wingèd souls may catch the king’s, Or, like obedient subjects, follow him To his new kingdom of ne'er-changing night.	If you’re going to die, be quick about it so you can catch the king’s departing soul or follow him, like obedient subjects, to his new kingdom of endless night.
O, what cause have I, Thine being but a moiety of my moan, To overgo thy woes and drown thy cries!	Since your woes are only a portion of mine, I have every reason to surpass your lamentations and drown out your cries with my own.
All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes, That I, being governed by the watery moon, May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world.	I could drown the world.
Ah, for my husband, for my dear lord Edward!	My poor husband, my dear Edward!
Ah, for our father, for our dear lord Clarence!	Our poor father, Clarence!
Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!	My sons Edward and Clarence!
What stay had I but Edward?	What support did I have other than Edward?
And he’s gone.	And now he’s gone.
What stay had we but Clarence?	What support did we have besides our father?
And he’s gone.	And now he’s gone.
And they are gone.	And now they’re both gone.
Was never widow had so dear a loss.	There has never been a widow who suffered such loss as me.
Were never orphans had so dear a loss.	There have never been orphans who’ve suffered what we have.
Was never mother had so dear a loss.	There was never a mother who suffered so much loss.
Alas, I am the mother of these griefs.	Alas, I am the mother of all these others' griefs.
She for an Edward weeps, and so do I; I for a Clarence weep; so doth not she.	She weeps for Edward and so do I, while she does not weep for Clarence, though I do.
These babes for Clarence weep and so do I; I for an Edward weep; so do not they.	These young children cry for Clarence and so do I, though they don’t cry for Edward, as I do.
Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother, Of the young prince your son.	Be a careful mother, madam, and think about your son, the young prince.
In him your comfort lives.	Your peace of mind depends on him.
Sister, have comfort.	Sister, calm down.
All of us have cause To wail the dimming of our shining star, But none can help our harms by wailing them.— Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy; I did not see your Grace.	All of us have reason to mourn the dimming of our shining star the king.
Humbly on my knee I crave your blessing.	On my knee, I humbly ask your blessing.
God bless thee, and put meekness in thy breast, Love, charity, obedience, and true duty.	God bless you and make you obedient, loving, and kind.
You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers That bear this heavy mutual load of moan, Now cheer each other in each other’s love.	You mournful princes and grieving gentlemen who have been sharing this burden of grief, now it’s time to cheer each other up with love.
Though we have spent our harvest of this king, We are to reap the harvest of his son.	Though we have lost a generous king, we are about to enjoy the benefits of a new king.
The broken rancor of your high-swoll'n hates, But lately splintered, knit, and joined together, Must gently be preserved, cherished, and kept.	We must preserve our goodwill toward each other and not break into factions again.
Meseemeth good that with some little train Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fet Hither to London, to be crowned our king.	I think a few members of the court should fetch the young prince from Wales and bring him to London to be crowned our king.
Why “with some little train,” my Lord of Buckingham?	Why only a few courtiers, my lord of Buckingham?
I hope the king made peace with all of us; And the compact is firm and true in me.	The king made peace among all of us.
And so in me, and so, I think, in all.	And so do I. I think we all do.
Therefore I say with noble Buckingham That it is meet so few should fetch the prince.	So, I agree with noble Buckingham—only a few should go to meet the prince.
And so say I.	I think so too.
My lord, whoever journeys to the prince, For God’s sake let not us two at home.	For God’s sake, my lord, let’s be sure to be part of the group that meets the prince.
For by the way I’ll sort occasion, As index to the story we late talked of, To part the queen’s proud kindred from the prince.	Along the way, I’ll find an opportunity to separate him from the queen’s proud relatives, as step one in the plan we’ve discussed.
My other self, my council’s consistory, My oracle, my prophet, my dear cousin, I, as a child, will go by thy direction Toward Ludlow then, for we’ll not stay behind.	You are my other self, my oracle, my prophet, my dear brother!
Good morrow, neighbor, whither away so fast?	Good morrow, neighbor, whither away so fast?
I promise you I scarcely know myself.	I’m telling you, I hardly know myself.
Hear you the news abroad?	Did you hear the news that’s going around?
Yes, that the king is dead.	Yes, that the king is dead.
Neighbors, God speed.	Neighbors, hello.
Give you good morrow, sir.	Good day to you, sir.
Doth this news hold of good King Edward’s death?	Is it true that good King Edward has died?
Ay, sir, it is too true, God help the while.	Yes, sir, it’s all too true, God help us.
Then, masters, look to see a troublous world.	Then, gentlemen, we can count on trouble.
No, no, by God’s good grace, his son shall reign.	No, no, with God’s help, his son will be king.
Woe to the land that’s governed by a child.	It’s bad news when a country is ruled by a child.
In him there is a hope of government, Which, in his nonage, council under him, And, in his full and ripened years, himself, No doubt shall then, and till then, govern well.	His counselors will govern as long as he’s a minor, and then he’ll take over.
With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must.	With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must.
More pity that the eagle should be mewed While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.	It’s a shame that we eagles are caged up while the vultures are free to do whatever they please.
What news abroad?	What’s the news abroad?
Tis very grievous to be thought upon.	Very sad.
Where is he, in his bed?	Where is he, in his bed?
He is.	He is.
Go you before, and I will follow you.	You go ahead, and I will follow you.
So stood the state when Henry the Sixth Was crowned in Paris but at nine months old.	That’s how it was with Henry the Sixth, who was crowned in Paris when he was only nine months old.
Stood the state so?	Really?
Better it were they all came by his father, Or by the father there were none at all, For emulation who shall now be nearest Will touch us all too near if God prevent not.	It would be better if they were all on his father’s side, or that there were none at all on his father’s side.
O, full of danger is the duke of Gloucester, And the queen’s sons and brothers haught and proud, And were they to be ruled, and not to rule, This sickly land might solace as before.	Richard, the duke of Gloucester, is very dangerous, and the queen’s sons and brothers are haughty and proud—it would be better for this ailing country if they were subjects, not rulers.
Come, come, we fear the worst.	Come, come, we’re worrying about the worst-case scenario.
All will be well.	I’m sure everything will be fine.
Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.	When storms arrive early, you can expect the harvest will be damaged.
All may be well; but if God sort it so, 'Tis more than we deserve or I expect.	So, if all turns out fine, as you say, it’s more than we deserve or I expect.
Before the days of change, still is it so.	It’s always like this in times of change.
But leave it all to God.	But leave it all to God.
Whither away?	Where are you all off to?
Marry, we were sent for to the justices.	The court has sent for us.
Tomorrow or next day they will be here.	They’ll be here tomorrow or the next day.
I long with all my heart to see the prince.	I’m dying to see the prince.
I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.	I hope he’s grown a lot since I last saw him.
Ay, mother, but I would not have it so.	Yes, mother, but I wish I hadn’t.
Why, my young cousin?	Why, dear child?
It is good to grow.	It’s good to grow.
Grandam, one night as we did sit at supper, My uncle Rivers talked how I did grow More than my brother: “Ay,” quoth my uncle Gloucester, “Small herbs have grace; great weeds do grow apace.” And since, methinks I would not grow so fast Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.	Yes,” said my uncle Gloucester, “Small plants are graceful, while ugly weeds grow fast.” And since then, I’ve wished I wouldn’t grow so fast, because sweet flowers are slow while the weeds grow in a hurry.
Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold In him that did object the same to thee!	Well, it certainly wasn’t true for Richard!
He was the wretched’st thing when he was young, So long a-growing and so leisurely, That if this rule were true, he should be gracious.	As a child, he took such a long time to grow up that, according to his rule, he should have grown up into a gracious adult.
And so no doubt he is, my gracious madam.	And no doubt he is, gracious madam.
I hope he is, but yet let mothers doubt.	I hope he is, but mothers get to have their doubts.
Now, by my troth, if I had been remembered, I could have given my uncle’s grace a flout To touch his growth nearer than he touched mine.	Hey, if I’d remembered something about him, I could have had a good comeback for my uncle, touching on his growth worse than he touched on mine.
How, my pretty York?	What would you have said, my young York?
I prithee let me hear it.	Do tell.
Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old.	Indeed, they say my uncle grew so fast that he could gnaw on a crust of bread when he was two hours old.
Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.	It took me two years before I had a single tooth.
Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.	Grandmother, this would have been a biting joke.
I prithee, pretty York, who told thee this?	Pretty York, who told you about his teeth?
Grandam, his nurse.	His nurse, grandmother.
His nurse?	His nurse?
Why, she was dead ere thou wast born.	Why, she was dead before you were even born.
If ’twere not she, I cannot tell who told me.	Well, if it wasn’t her, I don’t know.
A parlous boy!	A mischievous child.
Go to, you are too shrewd.	Come, come, you are too clever for your own good.
Good madam, be not angry with the child.	Good lady, don’t be angry with the child.
Pitchers have ears.	Little pitchers have big ears.
Here comes a messenger.	Here comes a messenger.
What news?	What’s the news?
Such news, my lord, as grieves me to report.	My lord, it’s news I wish I didn’t have to report.
How doth the prince?	How’s the prince?
Well, madam, and in health.	He’s fine and healthy, madam.
What is thy news then?	What is your news?
The mighty dukes, Gloucester and Buckingham.	The powerful dukes Gloucester and Buckingham.
For what offence?	What did they do wrong?
The sum of all I can, I have disclosed.	I’ve told you everything I know.
Why, or for what, the nobles were committed Is all unknown to me, my gracious lord.	Why the nobles were imprisoned, and on what charges, I don’t know, my gracious lord.
Ay me!	Oh no!
I see the ruin of my house.	I see the downfall of my family.
Welcome, destruction, blood, and massacre.	Welcome, destruction, blood, and massacre!
My husband lost his life to get the crown, And often up and down my sons were tossed For me to joy, and weep, their gain and loss.	My husband lost his life to get the crown, and my sons' fortunes have been tossed up and down, leaving me to rejoice over their victories and weep over their losses.
O, preposterous And frantic outrage, end thy damnèd spleen, Or let me die, to look on death no more.	Let it end, or let me die so I won’t have to watch any more of it.
The weary way hath made you melancholy.	The tiring journey seems to have made you gloomy.
No, uncle, but our crosses on the way Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy.	It wasn’t the journey itself, uncle, but the troubles we encountered that made it wearisome and dull.
I want more uncles here to welcome me.	I want more uncles here to welcome me.
Those uncles which you want were dangerous.	Those uncles that you wish were here were dangerous.
Your Grace attended to their sugared words But looked not on the poison of their hearts.	Your Grace heard their saccharine words, but didn’t take note of their poisonous intentions.
God keep you from them, and from such false friends.	God protect you from them and from other false friends!
God keep me from false friends, but they were none.	God should keep me from false friends, but they weren’t false.
My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet you.	My lord, the mayor of London is here to greet you.
God bless your Grace with health and happy days.	God bless your Grace with health and happy days.
Fie, what a slug is Hastings that he comes not To tell us whether they will come or no!	And what a slug Hastings is that he hasn’t even arrived to tell us whether they’re coming!
And in good time here comes the sweating lord.	And, just in time, here comes the sweaty lord.
Welcome, my lord.	Welcome, my lord.
What, will our mother come?	What, isn’t my mother coming?
On what occasion God He knows, not I, The queen your mother and your brother York Have taken sanctuary.	God knows why, but your mother and your brother have taken sanctuary in Westminster Abbey.
The tender prince Would fain have come with me to meet your Grace, But by his mother was perforce withheld.	Your sweet brother wanted to come meet you, but his mother wouldn’t let him.
Not for all this land Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.	I wouldn’t commit so serious a crime for anything.
Weigh it but with the grossness of this age, You break not sanctuary in seizing him.	In these less dainty times, you’re not breaking the laws of sanctuary to seize him.
This prince hath neither claimed it nor deserved it And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it.	The prince has done neither; therefore, in my opinion, he isn’t really protected by sanctuary.
Oft have I heard of sanctuary men, But sanctuary children, ne'er till now.	Often I have heard of “sanctuary men,” but until now I’ve never heard of “sanctuary children.” My lord, you’ve won me over this time.
My lord, you shall o'errule my mind for once.— Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?	Lord Hastings, will you go with me?
I go, my lord.	I’m coming, my lord.
Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.	Go as fast as you can.
Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come, Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?	Say, uncle Richard, if my brother comes, where will I stay till my coronation?
Where it seems best unto your royal self.	Whatever seems best to you.
I do not like the Tower, of any place.— Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?	Of all places, I don’t like the
He did, my gracious lord, begin that place, Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.	He started it, my noble lord, and succeeding generations rebuilt it.
Is it upon record, or else reported Successively from age to age, he built it?	Is it on record that he built it, or is it just word of mouth?
Upon record, my gracious lord.	On record, my gracious lord.
But say, my lord, it were not registered, Methinks the truth should live from age to age, As ’twere retailed to all posterity, Even to the general all-ending day.	Well, I think that even if it weren’t on record, the truth would be remembered from one generation to the next—all the way to Doomsday.
What say you, uncle?	What did you say, uncle?
Death makes no conquest of this conqueror, For now he lives in fame, though not in life.	Death didn’t conquer
He cannot live, I hope, and must not die Till George be packed with post-horse up to heaven.	The king won’t live, I hope.
For then I’ll marry Warwick’s youngest daughter.	I’ll marry the earl of Warwick’s youngest daughter, Lady Anne.
What though I killed her husband and her father?	So what if I killed her husband and her father?
The readiest way to make the wench amends Is to become her husband and her father; The which will I, not all so much for love As for another secret close intent By marrying her which I must reach unto.	So that’s what I’ll do, not because I love her but because I’ll get something out of it.
But yet I run before my horse to market.	But I’m running ahead of myself.
Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns.	Clarence is still alive; Edward is not only alive, he’s king.
When they are gone, then must I count my gains.	Only when they’re dead can I start to count my gains.
What, my gracious lord?	What, my dear lord?
Richard of York, how fares our loving brother?	Richard of York, how are you doing, my loving brother?
Well, my dread lord—so must I call you now.	Very well, my supreme lord—that’s what I have to call you now.
How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?	How’s my nephew doing, noble lord of York?
I thank you, gentle uncle.	Thank you for asking, uncle.
O, my lord, You said that idle weeds are fast in growth.	Oh, my lord, you once said that lazy weeds grow fast.
The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.	The prince has far outgrown me.
He hath, my lord.	He has, my lord.
And therefore is he idle?	Does that mean he’s lazy?
O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.	Oh, my handsome nephew, I must not say that.
Then is he more beholding to you than I.	In that case, he’s more obliged to you than I am.
He may command me as my sovereign, But you have power in me as in a kinsman.	He may command me as my king, but you still have power over me as a relative.
I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.	Uncle, please give me your dagger.
My dagger, little cousin?	My dagger, little nephew?
With all my heart.	With all my heart.
A beggar, brother?	Are you begging, brother?
Of my kind uncle, that I know will give, And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.	From my kind uncle, who I know will give it to me, especially as it’s not worth much.
A greater gift than that I’ll give my cousin.	I’ll give you a greater gift than that, nephew.
A greater gift?	A greater gift?
O, that’s the sword to it.	That must mean a sword.
Ay, gentle cousin, were it light enough.	Yes, gentle cousin, if it were light enough for you.
O, then I see you will part but with light gifts.	Oh, I see, you will only part with lightweight presents.
In weightier things you’ll say a beggar nay.	For more important things, you’ll say no.
It is too heavy for your Grace to wear.	A sword’s too heavy for you to wear.
I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.	I wouldn’t think much of it even if it were heavier.
How?	What’s that?
Uncle, your Grace knows how to bear with him.	But, uncle, you know how to bear with him.
You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me.— Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me.	You mean, to bear me, not to bear        My protector, Richard, insists on it.
I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.	I can’t sleep quietly in the Tower.
Why, what should you fear?	Why, what are you afraid of?
Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost.	My uncle Clarence’s angry ghost.
My grandam told me he was murdered there.	My grandmother told me he was murdered there.
I fear no uncles dead.	I’m not afraid of dead uncles.
Nor none that live, I hope.	Nor living ones, I hope.
An if they live, I hope I need not fear.	Well, I hope not.
No doubt, no doubt.	No doubt, no doubt.
O, ’tis a parlous boy, Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable.	Oh, he’s a dangerously clever boy—bold, quick-witted, capable.
He is all the mother’s, from the top to toe.	He’s his mother’s child from head to toe.
Well, let them rest.—Come hither, Catesby.	Well, enough about them.—Come here, Catesby.
He, for his father’s sake, so loves the prince That he will not be won to aught against him.	Hastings loved the prince’s father so much that we won’t be able to persuade him to do anything against the prince.
What think’st thou then of Stanley?	What about Stanley?
Will not he?	Won’t he join us?
He will do all in all as Hastings doth.	He’ll do whatever Hastings does.
Well then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby, And, as it were far off, sound thou Lord Hastings How he doth stand affected to our purpose And summon him tomorrow to the Tower To sit about the coronation.	Okay, just do this, noble Catesby: sound out Lord Hastings, but make it seem as if you’re just mulling over the idea, that it hasn’t been firmed up yet.
If thou dost find him tractable to us, Encourage him and show him all our reasons.	If he seems game to our plan, encourage him to join us and explain all our reasons.
If he be leaden, icy, cold, unwilling, Be thou so too, and so break off the talk, And give us notice of his inclination; For we tomorrow hold divided councils, Wherein thyself shalt highly be employed.	But if he’s resistant and chilly, then be like that too and break off the conversation.
Commend me to Lord William.	Give my regards to Hastings, Catesby.
My good lords both, with all the heed I can.	My good lords, I plan to.
Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?	Will we hear from you before bedtime, Catesby?
You shall, my lord.	You will, my lord.
At Crosby Place, there shall you find us both.	You’ll find us both at Crosby Place.
Now, my lord, what shall we do, if we perceive Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?	Now, my lord, what are we going to do if we find that Lord Hastings won’t go along with our plans?
Chop off his head.	Chop off his head.
Something we will determine.	Whatever we decide to do.
And look when I am king, claim thou of me The earldom of Hereford, and all the moveables Whereof the king my brother was possessed.	And when I’m king, remember to ask me for the earldom of Hereford and all the possessions that go with it, which my brother the king used to own.
I’ll claim that promise at your Grace’s hands.	I look forward to that present.
And look to have it yielded with all kindness.	You’ll find I’ll give it to you very willingly.
Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards We may digest our complots in some form.	Come, let’s have an early dinner so that we have time to work out our plans.
One from the Lord Stanley.	A messenger from Lord Stanley.
Upon the stroke of four.	Four o'clock in the morning.
Cannot my Lord Stanley sleep these tedious nights?	Can’t Lord Stanley sleep?
So it appears by that I have to say.	I guess not—for good reason, as you’ll soon hear.
First, he commends him to your noble self.	First, he sends his regards.
What then?	And then?
Then certifies your Lordship that this night He dreamt the boar had razèd his helm Besides, he says there are two councils kept, And that may be determined at the one Which may make you and him to rue at th' other.	Besides that, he says that two meetings are going to be held tomorrow, and something may be decided at one of them that may make you and him, who are at the other, sorry.
His Honor and myself are at the one, And at the other is my good friend Catesby, Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us Whereof I shall not have intelligence.	While he and I are at one, my loyal servant Catesby will be at the other, so nothing will happen that we won’t find out about.
Tell him his fears are shallow, without instance.	Tell your master there is no sound basis for his worries.
And for his dreams, I wonder he’s so simple To trust the mock'ry of unquiet slumbers.	And as for his dreams, I’m surprised he’s so foolish as to trust the fantasies of a restless night.
To fly the boar before the boar pursues Were to incense the boar to follow us And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.	If we flee from the boar before the boar even pursues us, we’ll only make the boar angry and suspicious, causing him to chase us when he never intended to.
Many good morrows to my noble lord.	Good morning, my noble lord.
Good morrow, Catesby.	Good day, Catesby.
You are early stirring.	You’re up early.
What news, what news in this our tott'ring state?	What news can you tell me in this fast-moving, unsteady state of ours?
It is a reeling world indeed, my lord, And I believe will never stand upright Till Richard wear the garland of the realm.	I believe it won’t stop moving and stand upright till Richard wears the wreath of the realm.
How “wear the garland”?	What do you mean, “wears the wreath”?
Dost thou mean the crown?	Are you talking about the crown?
Ay, my good lord.	Yes, my good lord.
I’ll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders Before I’ll see the crown so foul misplaced.	I’ll have my head cut from my shoulders before I’ll see the crown so misplaced.
But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?	But do you think that’s what he’s aiming for?
Ay, on my life, and hopes to find you forward Upon his party for the gain thereof; And thereupon he sends you this good news, That this same very day your enemies, The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret.	For that reason he sends you this good news—that this very day your enemies, the queen’s relatives, will die at Pomfret.
Indeed, I am no mourner for that news, Because they have been still my adversaries.	Well, I’m not sorry to hear that, because they have always been my enemies.
God keep your Lordship in that gracious mind.	Well, let’s hope you stay in that noble frame of mind.
Well, Catesby, ere a fortnight make me older I’ll send some packing that yet think not on ’t.	But as for now—before two weeks have gone by, I’m going to send some people packing.

Wot you what, my lord?	You know what, my lord?
Today the lords you talked of are beheaded.	Those men you just mentioned will be beheaded today.

What, go you toward the Tower?	Are you headed to the Tower?
I shall return before your Lordship thence.	I’ll be off before you are.

Who knows the Lord Protector’s mind herein?	Who knows what the Lord Protector thinks?
Who is most inward with the noble duke?	Who’s closest to him?
Your Grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.	You, I think, would best know what he’s thinking.

Young Edward lives; think now what I would speak.	Young Prince Edward is still alive—what do you think I’m going to say next?
Say on, my loving lord.	Go on, my loving lord.

I will resolve you herein presently.	I’ll let you know my answer shortly.
And unrespective boys.	My lord?

His name, my lord, is Tyrrel.	His name is Tyrrel, my lord.
I partly know the man.	I know the man a bit.

Rumor it abroad That Anne my wife is very grievous sick.	Spread the rumor abroad that Anne, my wife, is very sick.
Inquire me out some mean poor gentleman, Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter.	And find a poverty stricken gentleman who I can marry straightaway to Clarence’s daughter.

I say again, give out That Anne my queen is sick and like to die.	I repeat, spread the rumor that Anne, my wife, is sick and likely to die.
Is thy name Tyrrel?	Are you Tyrrel?
James Tyrrel, and your most obedient subject.	James Tyrrel—and your most obedient subject.
Art thou indeed?	Are you indeed?
Dar’st thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?	Do you dare kill a friend of mine?
Why then, thou hast it.	Well, that’s what you get to do.
Two deep enemies, Foes to my rest, and my sweet sleep’s disturbers, Are they that I would have thee deal upon.	Two great enemies, in fact, enemies to my peace of mind.
Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower.	Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower.
Let me have open means to come to them, And soon I’ll rid you from the fear of them.	Give me access to them, and soon you won’t have to worry about them anymore.
Thou sing’st sweet music.	That’s music to my ears.
Hark, come hither, Tyrrel.	Come here, Tyrrel.
Go, by this token.	By this token, you’ll be admitted to their cell.
Rise, and lend thine ear.	Get up and listen to me.
There is no more but so.	That’s all there is to it.
Say it is done, And I will love thee and prefer thee for it.	As soon as the deed is done, you will be in my favor and I will promote you.
I will dispatch it straight.	I’ll do it right away.
My lord, I have considered in my mind The late request that you did sound me in.	My lord, I have thought over the request you just made of me.

What says your Highness to my just request?	What do you say, your Highness, about my just request?
I do remember me, Henry the Sixth Did prophesy that Richmond should be king, When Richmond was a little peevish boy.	As I remember, Henry the Sixth prophesied that Richmond would be king when Richmond was only a foolish little boy.
A king, perhaps— My lord— How chance the prophet could not at that time Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?	A king, perhaps— My lord— How is it that the prophet didn’t tell me at the time that I would kill him?
My lord, your promise for the earldom— Richmond!	My lord, your promise of the earldom— Richmond!
When last I was at Exeter, The mayor in courtesy showed me the castle And called it Rougemont, at which name I started, Because a bard of Ireland told me once I should not live long after I saw Richmond.	The last time I was in Exeter, the mayor kindly showed me the castle there and called it “ My lord!
My Lord— Ay, what’s o'clock?	Yes, what time is it?
I am thus bold to put your Grace in mind Of what you promised me.	I’m reminding your grace what you promised me.
Well, but what’s o'clock?	Well, but what time is it?
Upon the stroke of ten.	It’s almost ten o'clock.
Well, let it strike.	Well, let it strike ten then.
Why let it strike?	Why “let it strike”?
Because that, like a jack, thou keep’st the stroke Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.	Because you’re like the lowborn fellow who strikes the bell—you keep interrupting my thoughts.
I am not in the giving vein today.	I am not in the giving mood today.
Why then, resolve me whether you will or no.	You’re bothering me.
Thou troublest me; I am not in the vein.	I’m not in the mood.
And is it thus?	Is this really happening?
Repays he my deep service With such deep contempt?	Does he reward my dedicated service with such deep contempt?
Made I him king for this?	Did I work to make him king for this?
O, let me think on Hastings and be gone To Brecknock, while my fearful head is on!	Oh, let me remember what happened to Hastings and hurry to
The tyrannous and bloody act is done, The most arch deed of piteous massacre That ever yet this land was guilty of.	It was the most ruthless massacre this country has ever been guilty of.
Dighton and Forrest, whom I did suborn To do this piece of ruthless butchery, Albeit they were fleshed villains, bloody dogs, Melted with tenderness and mild compassion, Wept like two children in their deaths' sad story.	Dighton and Forrest, whom I hired to perform the butchery, are used to killing people, the bloody dogs.
Their lips were four red roses on a stalk, And in their summer beauty kissed each other.	Their lips, like four red roses on a stalk, touched.
Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?	Kind Tyrrel, will your news make me happy?
If to have done the thing you gave in charge Beget your happiness, be happy then, For it is done.	If my doing what you told me to makes you happy, then be happy, because I did it.

And buried, gentle Tyrrel?	And buried, noble Tyrrel?
The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them, But where, to say the truth, I do not know.	The Tower’s chaplain has buried them, but to tell you the truth, I don’t know where.
Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after-supper, When thou shalt tell the process of their death.	Tyrrel, come back shortly after dinner and tell me the details of their deaths.
Meantime, but think how I may do thee good, And be inheritor of thy desire.	In the meantime, think about how I can do you good and give you what you want.
Farewell till then.	See you soon.
I humbly take my leave.	I humbly say goodbye.
The son of Clarence have I pent up close, His daughter meanly have I matched in marriage, The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham’s bosom, And Anne my wife hath bid this world goodnight.	Edward’s sons have been carried off by the angels and Anne, my wife, has bid good night to the world.
Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims At young Elizabeth, my brother’s daughter, And by that knot looks proudly on the crown, To her go I, a jolly thriving wooer.

Morton is fled to Richmond, And Buckingham, backed with the hardy Welshmen, Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.	The Bishop of Ely has fled to Richmond, and Buckingham, backed by a hardy Welsh army, is on the march.
Ely with Richmond troubles me more near Than Buckingham and his rash-levied strength.	Ely joining Richmond troubles me more than Buckingham and his quickly assembled army.
Say that I slew them not.	Let’s say I didn’t kill them.
Then say they were not slain.	Then you might as well say they’re not dead.

Queen Margaret saw Thy murd'rous falchion smoking in his blood, The which thou once didst bend against her breast, But that thy brothers beat aside the point.	Queen Margaret saw your sword steaming with his blood.
I was provokèd by her sland'rous tongue, That laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.	She provoked me with her lying mouth, accusing me of crimes I didn’t commit.
Thou wast provokèd by thy bloody mind, That never dream’st on aught but butcheries.	No, what provoked you was your own bloody mind, which never thinks about anything but butchering.
Didst thou not kill this king?	You killed this king, didn’t you?
I grant you.	Yes, I’ll grant you that.
Dost grant me, hedgehog?	You’ll grant me, you hedgehog?

The better for the King of heaven that hath him.	That will please God, who has him now.
He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.	He is in heaven, where you will never go.
Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither, For he was fitter for that place than earth.	Let him thank me, who helped him get there.
Here in these confines slyly have I lurked To watch the waning of mine enemies.	I’ve lurked in the shadows here to watch the downfall of my enemies.
A dire induction am I witness to, And will to France, hoping the consequence Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.	I’ll head to France soon.
Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret.	It’s time to hide, wretched Margaret.
Who comes here?	Who’s coming?
Ah, my poor princes!	Ah, my poor princes!
Ah, my tender babes, My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets, If yet your gentle souls fly in the air And be not fixed in doom perpetual, Hover about me with your airy wings And hear your mother’s lamentation.	If your gentle souls are still flying in the air and have not yet landed where they will remain forever, hover around me with your airy wings and hear your mother’s lament.
Hover about her; say that right for right Hath dimmed your infant morn to agèd night.	Hover about her and tell her she got what she deserved, with her children dead before their time.
So many miseries have crazed my voice That my woe-wearied tongue is still and mute.	I’ve been crazed with so many miseries that my tongue has tired of lamenting and gone mute.
Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?	Edward Plantagenet, why are you dead?
Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs And throw them in the entrails of the wolf?	Will you abandon such gentle lambs, God, and throw them to the wolves?
When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?	Have you ever slept before while such a terrible deed was done?
Give mine the benefit of seigniory, And let my griefs frown on the upper hand.	Let my sorrow have the upper hand.
I had a Richard too, and thou did’st kill him; I had a Rutland too; thou holp’st to kill him.	You had a Clarence, too, and Richard killed him.
O upright, just, and true-disposing God, How do I thank thee that this carnal cur Preys on the issue of his mother’s body And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!	Oh righteous God, how can I thank you enough that this meat-eating mutt preys on his mother’s children and forces her to join others in their grief!
O Harry’s wife, triumph not in my woes!	O Harry’s wife, do not triumph in my sorrow!
God witness with me, I have wept for thine.	With God as my witness, I swear I have wept for yours.
Thy Edward he is dead, that killed my Edward, Thy other Edward dead, to quit my Edward; Young York, he is but boot, because both they Matched not the high perfection of my loss.	Your son Edward, who stabbed my son Edward, is dead.
Thy Clarence he is dead that stabbed my Edward, And the beholders of this frantic play, Th' adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey, Untimely smothered in their dusky graves.	Your Clarence, who stabbed my Edward, is also dead.
Richard yet lives, hell’s black intelligencer, Only reserved their factor to buy souls And send them thither.	Richard, a fiendish spy for hell itself, still lives, but only long enough to buy souls to send below.
Cancel his bond of life, dear God I pray, That I may live to say, “The dog is dead.”	I pray that God ends his life before I die, so I can say, “The dog is dead!”
O, thou didst prophesy the time would come That I should wish for thee to help me curse That bottled spider, that foul bunch-backed toad!	Oh, you prophesied that the time would come when I would want your help in cursing that humpbacked spider, that hideous toad!
I called thee then “vain flourish of my fortune.” I called thee then poor shadow, “painted queen,” The presentation of but what I was, The flattering index of a direful pageant, One heaved a-high, to be hurled down below, A mother only mocked with two fair babes, A dream of what thou wast, a garish flag To be the aim of every dangerous shot, A sign of dignity, a breath, a bubble, A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.	Back then, I called you “a poor, imitation queen,” a badly reproduced copy of what I was, a pretty prologue for the tragedy that was about to follow, a woman who was lifted high only to be hurled down to hell, a mother only teased with two beautiful children, who would soon die.
Where is thy husband now?	And I was right, because where’s your husband now?
Where be thy brothers?	Your brothers?
Where are thy two sons?	Your two sons?
Thus hath the course of justice whirled about And left thee but a very prey to time, Having no more but thought of what thou wast To torture thee the more, being what thou art.	Now you have only the memory of what you were, which tortures you when you consider what you’ve become.
Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?	You once stole my position; now you get to have the grief that goes with it.
These English woes will make me smile in France.	Your English sorrows will make me smile in France.
O, thou well-skilled in curses, stay awhile, And teach me how to curse mine enemies.	You who are so skilled in cursing, stay awhile and teach me how to curse my enemies.
Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days; Compare dead happiness with living woe; Think that thy babes were sweeter than they were, And he that slew them fouler than he is.	Remember your children as being sweeter than they actually were, and think of the man who killed them as worse than he is.
Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse.	Making your loss greater makes the person who caused it worse.
Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.	Think like this all day, and you’ll learn how to curse.
My words are dull.	My words are dull.
O, quicken them with thine!	Enliven them with yours!
Thy woes will make them sharp and pierce like mine.	Your misery will make them sharp and piercing like mine.
Why should calamity be full of words?	But give words a chance.
If so, then be not tongue-tied.	If that’s true, then don’t be tongue-tied.
Go with me, And in the breath of bitter words let’s smother My damnèd son that thy two sweet sons smothered.	Come with me, and let’s smother my fiendish son—who smothered your two sweet sons—in bitter words.
Who intercepts my expedition?	Who’s blocking the way?
O, she that might have intercepted thee, By strangling thee in her accursèd womb, From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done.	The woman who might have blocked you from all the murders you’ve committed by strangling you in her cursed womb.
Hid’st thou that forehead with a golden crown Where should be branded, if that right were right, The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown And the dire death of my poor sons and brothers?	Are you hiding your forehead with a golden crown, when, if there was any justice in this world, it should be branded with the murders you committed—your slaughter of the prince who held that crown, and of my sons and my brothers?

Strike alarum, drums!	Play, trumpets!
Let not the heavens hear these telltale women Rail on the Lord’s anointed.	Don’t let the heavens hear these chattery women abuse the Lord’s anointed king.
Strike, I say!	Play, I say!
Either be patient and entreat me fair, Or with the clamorous report of war Thus will I drown your exclamations.	Either be calm and polite or I’ll drown you out with the music of war.
Art thou my son?	Are you my son?
Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself.	Yes, I thank God, my father, and yourself.
Then patiently hear my impatience.	Then patiently listen to my impatience.
Madam, I have a touch of your condition, Which cannot brook the accent of reproof.	Madam, I’m a bit like you in that I can’t tolerate a tone of disapproval.
O, let me speak!	Oh, let me speak!
Do then, but I’ll not hear.	Go ahead, but I won’t listen.
I will be mild and gentle in my words.	I’ll be gentle and mild.
And brief, good mother, for I am in haste.	And brief, good mother—I’m in a hurry.
Art thou so hasty?	Are you that impatient?
I have stayed for thee, God knows, in torment and in agony.	God knows I waited for you in anguish, pain, and agony when I gave birth to you.
And came I not at last to comfort you?	And didn’t I finally arrive to comfort you?
What comfortable hour canst thou name, That ever graced me in thy company?	So, what hour of comfort have I ever had in your company?
Faith, none but Humfrey Hower, that called your Grace To breakfast once, forth of my company.	Name one.
I prithee, hear me speak.	You’re too bitter.
You speak too bitterly.	Just listen this once.
Hear me a word, For I shall never speak to thee again.	I’ll never speak to you again.
So.	So be it.
Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse Abides in me.	Though I have far more reason, I don’t have as much energy to curse you.
I say amen to her.	But I say amen to everything she said.
Stay, madam.	Wait, madam.
I must talk a word with you.	I need to speak a word with you.
I have no more sons of the royal blood For thee to slaughter.	I have no more royal sons for you to murder.
You have a daughter called Elizabeth, Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.	You have a daughter named Elizabeth, who is virtuous and beautiful, aristocratic and full of grace.
And must she die for this?	And does she have to die for this?
O, let her live, And I’ll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty, Slander myself as false to Edward’s bed, Throw over her the veil of infamy.	Oh, let her live, and I’ll ruin her manners and her beauty.
So she may live unscarred of bleeding slaughter, I will confess she was not Edward’s daughter.	So that she may live, I’ll say I cheated on Edward and that she is not really his child.
Wrong not her birth.	Don’t wrong her birth.
She is a royal princess.	She has royal blood.
To save her life, I’ll say she is not so.	To save her life, I’ll say she doesn’t.
And only in that safety died her brothers.	Yes, as safe as her brothers' lives were.
No, to their lives ill friends were contrary.	Bad friends were.
My babes were destined to a fairer death If grace had blessed thee with a fairer life.	My children would have enjoyed a better death if God had blessed you with a purer life.
Whose hand soever launched their tender hearts, Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction.	Whichever hand literally stabbed their tender hearts, you’re the one who gave the order.
No doubt the murd'rous knife was dull and blunt Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart, To revel in the entrails of my lambs.	No doubt the murderous knife was blunt till it was sharpened on your stony heart—you reveled in my lambs' bloody guts.
But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame, My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys Till that my nails were anchored in thine eyes, And I, in such a desp'rate bay of death, Like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft, Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.	But constant expression of wild grief will only make it tame, so I’m not going to say any more about my boys until I’ve gouged your eyes out with my bare hands.
Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise And dangerous success of bloody wars As I intend more good to you and yours Than ever you or yours were by me harmed!	Madam, if I do as well as I think I’m going to do in these dangerous, violent wars, you and your relatives will have more good at my hands than you’ve ever had bad!
What good is covered with the face of heaven, To be discovered, that can do me good?	What good does heaven have in store that can do me any good now?
The advancement of your children, gentle lady.	The advancement of your children, noble lady.
Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads.	Advancement to some scaffold, to lose their heads.

Your bedchamber.	Your bedroom.
Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest!	There is no rest to be had in any bedroom where you are!
So will it, madam till I lie with you.	Exactly, madam, until I sleep with you.
Be brief, lest that the process of thy kindness Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.	Well, explain—but do it fast so that your puny store of kindness isn’t used up by talking about it.
Then know that from my soul I love thy daughter.	Then know that from my soul I love your daughter.

Be not so hasty to confound my meaning.	Don’t be so quick to twist my meaning.
Even he that makes her queen.	The one who makes her queen, of course.
Who else should be?	Who else should it be?
What, thou?	What, you?
How think you of it?	What do you think, madam?
How canst thou woo her?	How would you woo her?
Madam, with all my heart.	And  Madam, with all my heart.
You mock me, madam.	Come, come, you’re making fun of me.

There is no other way, Unless thou couldst put on some other shape And not be Richard, that hath done all this.	There isn’t any other way, unless you took on another form and became someone else.
Say that I did all this for love of her.	But suppose I did all the things you named out of love for her.

A grandam’s name is little less in love Than is the doting title of a mother.	A grandmother is loved hardly less than a mother is.
Your children were vexation to your youth, But mine shall be a comfort to your age.	Your children caused you trouble in your youth, but mine will bring you comfort in your old age.
I cannot make you what amends I would; Therefore accept such kindness as I can.	I can’t make up for everything that I’d like to, so accept such kindness as I can offer.
What, we have many goodly days to see!	Indeed, we have many good days to look forward to!
Go then, my mother; to thy daughter go.	Go, then, mother, to your daughter.
What were I best to say?	What should I say to her?
Her father’s brother Would be her lord?	That her father’s brother wants to be her husband?
Or shall I say her uncle?	Or should I say it’s her uncle?
Or he that slew her brothers and her uncles?	Or should I describe you as the one who killed her brothers and her uncles?
Under what title shall I woo for thee, That God, the law, my honor and her love Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?	How can I describe you that will make you appeal to the young woman and will also agree with God, the law, my honor, and her feelings?

Now civil wounds are stopped, peace lives again.	Civil wounds now can heal, and peace can live again.
That she may long live here, God say amen.	So that England may live a long life like this, let God say amen!
Take up the sword again, or take up me.	Take up the sword again, or take me up.
Arise, dissembler.	Get up, liar.
Though I wish thy death, I will not be the executioner.	Though I wish you were dead, I’m not going to be the one to kill you.
I have already.	I have already.
That was in thy rage.	You said it when you were furious.
Speak it again and, even with the word, This hand, which for thy love did kill thy love, Shall for thy love kill a far truer love.	Say it again—just one word, and my hand, which killed your lover out of love, will kill your far truer lover.
To both their deaths shalt thou be accessory.	You will be an accessory to both crimes.
I would I knew thy heart.	I wish I knew what was in your heart.
Tis figured in my tongue.	I’ve told you.
I fear me both are false.	I fear that your words and your heart are both false.
Then never man was man true.	Then no man has ever been honest.
Well, well, put up your sword.	Well, then, put your sword away.
Say then my peace is made.	Tell me that you’ll accept my love.
That shall you know hereafter.	You’ll know about that later.
But shall I live in hope?	But can I have some hope?
All men I hope live so.	I’d like to think all men have some hope.
Vouchsafe to wear this ring.	Please wear this ring.
Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.	Wear both the ring and my heart, because both are yours.
And if thy poor devoted servant may But beg one favor at thy gracious hand, Thou dost confirm his happiness forever.	And if I, your poor devoted servant, may ask you for one small favor, you will guarantee my happiness forever.
What is it?	What’s that?
That it would please you leave these sad designs To him that hath more cause to be a mourner, And presently repair to Crosby House, Where, after I have solemnly interred At Chertsey monast'ry this noble king And wet his grave with my repentant tears, I will with all expedient duty see you.	Please leave it to me to take care of the burial, as I have more reason to mourn than you do.
For divers unknown reasons, I beseech you, Grant me this boon.	For various reasons that must remain secret, please do this for me.
With all my heart, and much it joys me too To see you are become so penitent.— Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.	I’ll do it with all my heart.

Was ever woman in this humor wooed?	Has anyone ever courted a woman in this state of mind?
Was ever woman in this humor won?	And has anyone ever won her, as I’ve done?
I’ll have her, but I will not keep her long.	I’ll get her, but I won’t keep her long.
And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!	And yet, against all odds, I win her over!
Ha!	Ha!
Hath she forgot already that brave prince, Edward, her lord, whom I some three months since Stabbed in my angry mood at Tewkesbury?	Has she already forgotten her brave husband, Prince Edward, whom I stabbed on the battlefield three months ago in my anger?
A sweeter and a Lovellier gentleman, Framed in the prodigality of nature, Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal, The spacious world cannot again afford.	He was graced with lots of natural gifts, he was young, valiant, wise, and no doubt meant to be king.
And will she yet abase her eyes on me, That cropped the golden prime of this sweet prince And made her widow to a woeful bed?	And yet she cheapens herself by turning her gaze on me, who cut her sweet prince’s life short and made her a widow?
On me, whose all not equals Edward’s moiety?	On me, though I am barely half the man that Edward was?
On me, that halts and am misshapen thus?	On me, though I am limping and deformed?
My dukedom to a beggarly denier, I do mistake my person all this while!	I bet I’ve been wrong about myself all this time.
Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot, Myself to be a marv'lous proper man.	Even though I don’t see it, this lady thinks I’m a marvelously good-looking man.
I’ll be at charges for a looking glass And entertain a score or two of tailors To study fashions to adorn my body.	Time to buy myself a mirror and employ a few dozen tailors to dress me up in the current fashions.
Since I am crept in favor with myself, I will maintain it with some little cost.	Since I’m suddenly all the rage, it will be worth the cost.
But first I’ll turn yon fellow in his grave And then return lamenting to my love.	But first, I’ll dump this fellow in his grave, then return to my love weeping with grief.
Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass, That I may see my shadow as I pass.	Come out, beautiful sun—until I’ve bought a mirror to admire my reflection in, I’ll watch my shadow as I stroll along.
Have patience, madam.	Be patient, madam.
There’s no doubt his majesty Will soon recover his accustomed health.	I’m sure his majesty will recover his health soon.
If he were dead, what would betide on me?	Then you’ll be able to cheer  If he were dead, what would happen to me?
Ah, he is young, and his minority Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester, A man that loves not me nor none of you.	But he’s young, and as long as he’s too young to become king, Richard, the duke of Gloucester, has power over him.
Is it concluded that he shall be Protector?	Richard loves neither me nor any of you.
It is determined, not concluded yet; But so it must be if the king miscarry.	Has it been decided that Richard will be  It’s been decided, though not yet officially announced.
God make your Majesty joyful, as you have been.	I hope God makes you happy again, like you once were.
Saw you the king today, my lord of Derby?	Did you see the king today, Lord Derby?
But now the duke of Buckingham and I Are come from visiting his majesty.	Yes, the duke of Buckingham and I have just returned from visiting him.
What likelihood of his amendment, lords?	What are the chances of his getting better, lords?
Madam, good hope.	Madam, keep up hope.
His grace speaks cheerfully.	He seems cheerful.
God grant him health.	God give him health.
Did you confer with him?	Did you talk with him?
Ay, madam.	Yes, madam.
Would all were well—but that will never be.	I wish I could believe you that all was well!
They do me wrong, and I will not endure it!	They’re out to get me, and I won’t stand for it!
Who is it that complains unto the king That I, forsooth, am stern and love them not?	Which of you has been complaining to the king that I don’t like them?
Cannot a plain man live and think no harm, But thus his simple truth must be abused With silken, sly, insinuating jacks?	Can’t a plain man live and do no harm to anyone without being taken advantage of by a bunch of slick, sneaky lowlifes?
To whom in all this presence speaks your Grace?	Which of us are you referring to?
To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.	You, who are neither honest nor good.
When have I injured thee?	When did I ever do you any harm?
Or any of your faction?	Or any of you?
A plague upon you all!	Damn you all!
His royal grace, Whom God preserve better than you would wish, Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing while But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.	The king—whom I hope God will protect better than you would like—can’t get a minute’s rest without you bothering him with your outrageous complaints.
Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.	Brother, you’ve made a mistake.
I cannot tell.	He  I can’t tell what’s going on.
The world is grown so bad That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch.	The world has become so bad that now little wrens have settled where eagles used to roost.
Come, come, we know your meaning, brother Gloucester.	Come, come, I know what you’re referring to, Richard.
You envy my advancement, and my friends'.	You resent my friends' rise in society, and my own.
God grant we never may have need of you.	Let’s hope we never need your help for anything.
Meantime God grants that we have need of you.	Meanwhile, we’re the ones who need you.
Our brother is imprisoned by your means, Myself disgraced, and the nobility Held in contempt, while great promotions Are daily given to ennoble those That scarce some two days since were worth a noble.	My brother is imprisoned because of you, I am disgraced, and the nobility are held in contempt while those who two days ago weren’t worth a dime have suddenly been promoted.
By Him that raised me to this careful height From that contented hap which I enjoyed, I never did incense his majesty Against the duke of Clarence, but have been An earnest advocate to plead for him.	By the Lord who raised me to this weighty post from the happy and carefree life I used to enjoy, I promise you I never did anything to get the king to turn against the duke of Clarence.
And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover To entertain these fair well-spoken days, I am determinèd to prove a villain And hate the idle pleasures of these days.	Since I can’t amuse myself by being a lover, I’ve decided to become a villain.
Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous, By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams, To set my brother Clarence and the king In deadly hate, the one against the other; And if King Edward be as true and just As I am subtle, false, and treacherous, This day should Clarence closely be mewed up About a prophecy which says that “G” Of Edward’s heirs the murderer shall be.	I’ve set dangerous plans in motion, using lies, drunken prophecies, and stories about dreams to set my brother Clarence and the king against each other.
His majesty, Tend'ring my person’s safety, hath appointed This conduct to convey me to the Tower.	His majesty is so concerned about my personal safety that he has ordered them to conduct me to the  You’re being arrested?
Upon what cause?	Why?
Because my name is George.	Because my name is George.
Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours.	That’s not your fault!
He should, for that, commit your godfathers.	He should imprison the person who named you, instead.
O, belike his majesty hath some intent That you shall be new christened in the Tower.	Maybe the king is sending you to the Tower to have you renamed.
But what’s the matter, Clarence?	But, really, what’s going on, Clarence?
May I know?	Can you tell me?
What may she not?	She could even what?
I wis, your grandam had a worser match.	Certainly, your grandmother had a worse match.
My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs.	My lord of Gloucester, I have suffered your blunt upbraidings and your bitterness toward me for too long.
By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty With those gross taunts that oft I have endured.	By God, I will tell the king about these taunts.
I had rather be a country servant-maid Than a great queen with this condition, To be so baited, scorned, and stormèd at.	I would rather be a country serving maid than a great queen if it meant I could escape your scorn and constant harassment.
Small joy have I in being England’s queen.	I’ve had very little joy as England’s queen.
So should we you, if you should be our king.	If you were king, we would do the same.
If I should be?	If I were king?

Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out In sharing that which you have pilled from me!	Hear me, you wrangling pirates.
Which of you trembles not that looks on me?	Which of you does not tremble when you see me?
Foul, wrinkled witch, what mak’st thou in my sight?	Ugly, wrinkled witch, what are you doing here?
But repetition of what thou hast marred.	Only describing what you have ruined.
That will I make before I let thee go.	Or at least that’s what I plan to do before I let you go.
Wert thou not banishèd on pain of death?	Weren’t you banished on pain of death?
I was, but I do find more pain in banishment Than death can yield me here by my abode.	I was.

What, were you snarling all before I came, Ready to catch each other by the throat, And turn you all your hatred now on me?	Even  What, were you all snarling before I arrived, ready to catch each other by the throat like dogs, but now that I’m here, you turn your hatred toward me?
Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen, Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self.	All because of what happened to that brat Rutland?
Have done thy charm, thou hateful, withered hag.	Enough of your magic spells, you hateful, withered hag.
And leave out thee?	And leave you out?
Stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me.	Don’t move, dog.
The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul.	It’s your turn now.
Richard!	Richard.
Ha?	Yes?
I call thee not.	I didn’t call you.
I cry thee mercy, then, for I did think That thou hadst called me all these bitter names.	I beg your pardon—I thought it was me whom you were calling all those terrible names.
Why, so I did, but looked for no reply.	Yes, I was, but I don’t want an answer from you.
O, let me make the period to my curse!	Let me finish my curse.
Tis done by me, and ends in “Margaret.”   Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself.	I’ve finished it for you, and it ends in “Margaret.” He’s turned your curse against you, Margaret.
Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune, Why strew’st thou sugar on that bottled spider, Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?	Poor imitation queen, why do you align yourself with this humpbacked spider when he’s got you trapped in his deadly web?
The day will come that thou shalt wish for me To help thee curse that poisonous bunch-backed toad.	The day will come when you’ll wish I could help you cast spells against this poisonous, hunchbacked toad.
False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse, Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.	Woman, stop your frantic curses and false prophesies before we run out of patience and do something bad to you.
Foul shame upon you, you have all moved mine.	Shame on you; I’ve already run out of patience with you all.
Were you well served, you would be taught your duty.	If you got what you deserved, you would learn some respect.
To serve me well, you all should do me duty: Teach me to be your queen, and you my subjects.	What I deserve is that you treat me like a queen, and what you deserve is to act like my subjects.
O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty!	Give me what I deserve, and do your duty!
They that stand high have many blasts to shake them, And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces.	People in high positions are shaken by many blasts of wind, and when they fall, they shatter into pieces.
Good counsel, marry.	Good advice, indeed.
Learn it, learn it, marquess.	Take it to heart, Dorset.
It touches you, my lord, as much as me.	It applies to you as much as to me, my lord.
And turns the sun to shade.	But you turn that sun into a shadow.
Urge neither charity nor shame to me.	You are building your nest in
Uncharitably with me have you dealt, And shamefully my hopes by you are butchered.	Stop—if you can’t be kind, at least have some shame.
My charity is outrage, life my shame, And in that shame still live my sorrows' rage.	How dare you talk about kindness or shame.
Have done, have done.	Enough, enough.
Thy garments are not spotted with our blood, Nor thou within the compass of my curse.	Your clothes aren’t spattered with my family’s blood, and you aren’t affected by my curse.
Nor no one here, for curses never pass The lips of those that breathe them in the air.	No one here is affected by your curse, because curses are just words with no power.
What doth she say, my lord of Buckingham?	What is she saying, my lord?
Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.	Nothing that interests me, my good lord.
What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel, And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?	What, you ignore my kind advice and try to please the devil I’m warning you about?
My hair doth stand an end to hear her curses.	Her curses have made my hair stand on end.
And so doth mine.	Mine, too.
I muse why she’s at liberty.	I don’t understand why she’s not locked up.
I cannot blame her.	I can’t blame her.
I never did her any, to my knowledge.	I never caused her any harm, as far as I know.
Yet you have all the vantage of her wrong.	But you have all the advantages from the harm done.
Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid; He is franked up to fatting for his pains.	And look how he’s repaid poor Clarence for his loyalty—penned him up like a pig being fattened for slaughter.
God pardon them that are the cause thereof.	God pardon those who are responsible for Clarence’s troubles.
So do I ever  For had I cursed now, I had cursed myself.	I always pray for them
Yea, Richard, when I know, for I protest As yet I do not.	I’ll tell you as soon as I know, Richard, because at this point I have no idea.
But, as I can learn, He hearkens after prophecies and dreams, And from the crossrow plucks the letter  And says a wizard told him that by “G” His issue disinherited should be.	He picked out the letter “G” from the alphabet and said a wizard told him that “G” will take the throne away from his children.
And for my name of George begins with  It follows in his thought that I am he.	He thinks “G” is me.
Why, this it is when men are ruled by women.	Well, this is what happens when men let themselves be ruled by women.
Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower.	The king isn’t the one sending you to the Tower, Clarence.
My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, ’tis she That tempers him to this extremity.	It’s his wife, Lady Grey, who got him to do this.
Madam, his majesty doth call for you,— And for your Grace, —and yours, my gracious lords.	Madam, his majesty asks for you, and for you, Duke of Gloucester, and for you, my noble lords.
We wait upon your Grace.	We will wait on you, your majesty.
I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.	I do the wrong and am the first to start quarrels.
Now they believe it and withal whet me To be revenged on Rivers, Dorset, Grey; But then I sigh and, with a piece of scripture, Tell them that God bids us do good for evil; And thus I clothe my naked villainy With odd old ends stolen out of Holy Writ, And seem a saint when most I play the devil.	Dressing my out-and-out wickedness in scraps of Scripture, I look like a saint exactly when I’m most like the devil.
But, soft!	But quiet.
Are you now going to dispatch this thing?	Are you going to take care of this thing now?
We are, my lord, and come to have the warrant That we may be admitted where he is.	We are, my lord.
Well thought upon.	Good thinking.
I have it here about me.	I have it on me here.
Tut, tut, my lord, we will not stand to prate.	Tut, tut, my lord, we’re not going to stand around chit-chatting.
Talkers are no good doers.	Talkers aren’t good doers.
Be assured We go to use our hands and not our tongues.	Rest assured that we’re going there to use our hands, not our tongues.
Your eyes drop millstones, when fools' eyes drop tears.	When fools cry, you remain stony.
I like you lads.	I like you guys.
Go, go, dispatch.	Hurry now, get the job done.
We will, my noble lord.	We will, my noble lord.
Why looks your grace so heavily today?	Why do you look so depressed today, your Grace?
What was your dream, my lord?	What was your dream?
I pray you tell me.	Tell me.
Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower And was embarked to cross to Burgundy, And in my company my brother Gloucester, Who from my cabin tempted me to walk Upon the hatches.	I thought I had escaped from the Tower and was on a ship to France with my brother Richard, who persuaded me to leave my cabin and walk on deck with him.
Thence we looked toward England And cited up a thousand fearful times, During the wars of York and Lancaster That had befall'n us.	Looking toward England, we reminisced about the countless frightening experiences we’d had in the wars between the Yorks and the Lancasters.
O Lord, methought what pain it was to drown, What dreadful noise of waters in my ears, What sights of ugly death within my eyes.	Lord, how painful it was to drown.
Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wracks, A thousand men that fishes gnawed upon, Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl, Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels, All scattered in the bottom of the sea.	I saw a thousand shipwrecks, a thousand men whom fish had gnawed to the bone, huge anchors, chunks of gold, heaps of pearls, and precious jewels—all scattered on the bottom of the sea.
Had you such leisure in the time of death To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?	So you had time as you were dying to look around?
Methought I had, and often did I strive To yield the ghost, but still the envious flood Stopped in my soul and would not let it forth To find the empty, vast, and wand'ring air, But smothered it within my panting bulk, Who almost burst to belch it in the sea.	It wouldn’t let my soul find its way to air but smothered it inside my gasping body.
I passed, methought, the melancholy flood, With that sour ferryman which poets write of, Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.	In fact, the real nightmare had only just begun.
The first that there did greet my stranger-soul Was my great father-in-law, renownèd Warwick, Who spake aloud, “What scourge for perjury Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?” And so he vanished.	With the help of the grim  The first to greet me there was my great
No marvel, lord, though it affrighted you.	Clarence has arrived—lying, cowardly  I’m not surprised it scared you, my lord.
I am afraid, methinks, to hear you tell it.	It scares me just to hear you talk about it.
Ah keeper, keeper, I have done those things, That now give evidence against my soul, For Edward’s sake, and see how he requites me.— O God, if my deep prayers cannot appease thee, But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds, Yet execute thy wrath in me alone!	I did them for Edward’s sake—and look how he rewards me.—Oh God, if my prayers don’t satisfy you, and you have to avenge the wrongs I’ve done, at least punish me alone!
O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!— Keeper, I prithee sit by me awhile.	Please spare my innocent wife and children!—Kind warden, please stay with me for a while.
My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.	I’m feeling very low, and I need to sleep.
I will, my lord.	I’ll stay, my lord.
God give your Grace good rest.	May God bring you sleep!
Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours, Makes the night morning, and the noontide night.	Sorrow interrupts all hours and seasons.
Princes have but their titles for their glories, An outward honor for an inward toil,	The only glory princes have are their titles.
What wouldst thou, fellow?	What do you want, fellow?
And how cam’st thou hither?	And how did you get in here?
I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.	I want to speak with Clarence, and I came here on my legs.
What, so brief?	That’s it?
Tis better, sir, to be brief than tedious.—Let him see our commission, and talk no more.	Well, sir, it’s better to say little than to be tedious.
I am in this commanded to deliver The noble duke of Clarence to your hands.	It orders me to hand the noble duke of Clarence over to you.
There lies the duke asleep, and there the keys.	Here are the keys, and there is the duke, sleeping.
You may, sir.	You may, sir.
Tis a point of wisdom.	That’s a wise idea.
Fare you well.	Goodbye.
What, shall I stab him as he sleeps?	What, should I stab him while he sleeps?
No.	No.
He’ll say ’twas done cowardly, when he wakes.	When he wakes up!
Why, he shall never wake until the great Judgment Day.	Why, he won’t wake up till Judgment Day.
Why, then he’ll say we stabbed him sleeping.	Okay, so that’s when he’ll say we stabbed him in his sleep.
The urging of that word “judgment” hath bred a kind of remorse in me.	That word “judgment” makes me feel a bit guilty.
What, art thou afraid?	What, are you afraid?
Not to kill him, having a warrant, but to be damned for killing him, from the which no warrant can defend me.	Not of killing him, because I have a warrant for it, but of being damned for killing him, which no warrant can protect me from.
I thought thou hadst been resolute.	I thought you were resolved to do this.
So I am—to let him live.	I am resolved—to let him live.
I’ll back to the duke of Gloucester and tell him so.	I’ll go back to the duke of Gloucester and tell him so.
Nay, I prithee stay a little.	Please, just wait a minute.
I hope this passionate humor of mine will change.	I’m hoping my holy mood will pass.
It was wont to hold me but while one tells twenty.	It usually only lasts about twenty seconds.
How dost thou feel thyself now?	How are you feeling now?
Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me.	Actually, I’m still feeling some pangs of conscience.
Remember our reward when the deed’s done.	Remember the reward we’re getting when the deed’s done.
Zounds, he dies!	Jesus, let’s kill him!
I had forgot the reward.	I forgot about the reward.
Where’s thy conscience now?	Where’s your conscience now?
O, in the duke of Gloucester’s purse.	Oh, in the duke of Gloucester’s wallet.
So when he opens his purse to give us our reward, thy conscience flies out.	When he opens his wallet to give us our pay, your conscience will fly out?
Tis no matter.	It won’t matter.
Let it go.	Let it fly out.
There’s few or none will entertain it.	No one will listen to it.
What if it come to thee again?	And what will you do if it returns to you?
I’ll not meddle with it.	I won’t bother with it.
Tis a blushing, shamefaced spirit that mutinies in a man’s bosom.	It blushes, is easily embarrassed, and stages regular uprisings in a man’s heart.
I am strong-framed.	I’m strong-willed.
He cannot prevail with me.	He won’t get the better of me.
Spoke like a tall man that respects thy reputation.	Spoken like a brave man who respects his reputation.
Come, shall we fall to work?	Shall we get to work?
Take him on the costard with the hilts of thy sword, and then throw him into the malmsey butt in the next room.	We’ll hit him on the head with the handles of our swords, then throw him in the wine barrel in the next room.
O excellent device— and make a sop of him.	What an excellent idea—he’ll soak up the wine!
Strike!	Strike!
No, we’ll reason with him.	No, first let’s talk to him.
Where art thou, keeper?	Where are you, keeper?
Give me a cup of wine.	Give me a cup of wine.
You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.	You’ll have wine enough, my lord, soon.
In God’s name, what art thou?	In God’s name, who are you?
A man, as you are.	A man, like you.
But not, as I am, royal.	But not a member of the royal family, like me.
Nor you, as we are, loyal.	And you’re not loyal, like us.
Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.	Your voice is loud and commanding, but you look like a working man.
My voice is now the king’s, my looks mine own.	I’m speaking for the king, but I look like myself.
Your eyes do menace me.	Your eyes look threatening.
Why look you pale?	And why are you so pale?
Who sent you hither?	Who sent you here?
Wherefore do you come?	Why are you here?
To, to, to— To murder me?	To, to, to— To murder me?

You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so, And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.	You barely have the heart to tell me, so you can’t possibly have the nerve to do it.
Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?	Besides, how have I offended you, my friends?
Offended us you have not, but the king.	You didn’t offend us, you offended the king.
I shall be reconciled to him again.	He and I will make up.
Never, my lord.	Never, my lord.
Therefore prepare to die.	So prepare to die.
Are you drawn forth among a world of men To slay the innocent?	It’s your job in life to kill the innocent?
What is my offense?	What did I do wrong?
Where is the evidence that doth accuse me?	Where’s the evidence against me?
What lawful quest have given their verdict up Unto the frowning judge?	Where’s the jury, the judge, the lawful proceedings, the verdict?
Or who pronounced The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death Before I be convict by course of law?	Who pronounced this death sentence before a court of law could even convict me?
To threaten me with death is most unlawful.	For you to threaten to kill me is most unlawful.
I charge you, as you hope to have redemption, By Christ’s dear blood shed for our grievous sins, That you depart, and lay no hands on me.	If you hope to have your sins forgiven by Christ’s dear blood, which He shed for our terrible sins, you must leave and keep your hands off me.
What we will do, we do upon command.	What we do we have been commanded to do.
Even so.	All right.
An please your Worship, Brakenbury, You may partake of anything we say.	If you like, Brakenbury, you can listen to anything we say.

But, I’ll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world.	But when I say so, I swear she turns white as a sheet.
Doth not  Ay, Nurse, what of that?	Don’t “ Yes, Nurse, what about that?
Both with an  Ah, mocker, that’s the dog’s name.	They both begin with the letter “R.” Ah, you jokester—that’s the dog’s name.
Commend me to thy lady.	Give my compliments to your lady.
Ay, a thousand times.—Peter!	Yes, a thousand times.
Anon!	Peter!
Before and apace.	I’m ready.
The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse.	I sent the Nurse at nine o'clock.
Perchance she cannot meet him.	Maybe she can’t find him.
That’s not so.	That can’t be.
Oh, she is lame!	Oh, she’s slow!
Love’s heralds should be thoughts, Which ten times faster glide than the sun’s beams, Driving back shadows over louring hills.	Love’s messengers should be thoughts, which fly ten times faster than sunbeams.
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill Of this day’s journey, and from nine till twelve Is three long hours, yet she is not come.	That’s three hours since nine o'clock, but she hasn’t come back.
Had she affections and warm youthful blood, She would be as swift in motion as a ball.	If she was young and passionate, she’d move as fast as a ball.
My words would bandy her to my sweet love, And his to me.	My words would bounce her to my sweet love, and his words would bounce her back to me.
But old folks, many feign as they were dead, Unwieldy, slow, heavy, and pale as lead.	But a lot of old people act like they’re already dead—sluggish, slow, fat, and colorless, like lead.
O God, she comes.—O honey Nurse, what news?	Oh sweet Nurse, what news do you bring?
Hast thou met with him?	Have you spoken to him?
Send thy man away.	Send your man away.
Peter, stay at the gate.	Peter, wait for me at the gate.
Now, good sweet Nurse— O Lord, why look’st thou sad?	Now, good sweet Nurse—Oh Lord, why do you look so sad?
Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily.	Even if the news is sad, tell me with a smile on your face.
If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news By playing it to me with so sour a face.	If the news is good, you’re ruining the sweet news by playing a trick with a sour face like that.
I am aweary.	I am tired.
Give me leave awhile.	Leave me alone for a minute.
Fie, how my bones ache!	Oh my, my bones ache so much.
I would thou hadst my bones and I thy news.	I wish you had my bones, and I had your news.
Can you not stay awhile?	Can’t you wait for a moment?
Do you not see that I am out of breath?	Don’t you see that I’m out of breath?
How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath?	How can you be out of breath when you have enough breath to tell me that you’re out of breath?
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.	The excuse you make to delay the news is longer than the news itself.
Is thy news good, or bad?	Is the news good or bad?
Answer to that.	Answer that question.
Say either, and I’ll stay the circumstance.	Tell me if it’s good or bad, and I’ll wait for the details.
Let me be satisfied.	Tell me so I can be satisfied.
Is ’t good or bad?	Is it good or bad?
Well, you have made a simple choice.	Well, you have made a foolish choice.
You know not how to choose a man.	You don’t know how to pick a man.
Romeo!	Romeo?
No, not he, though his face be better than any man’s, yet his leg excels all men’s, and for a hand and a foot and a body, though they be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare.	No, not him, though his face is more handsome than any man’s, and his legs are prettier, and as for his hands and feet and body, they’re not much to speak of, and yet they’re beyond compare.
He is not the flower of courtesy, but, I’ll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb.	He’s not the most polite man in the world, but, believe me, he’s gentle as a lamb.
Go thy ways, wench.	Well, do what you want.
Serve God.	Be good.
What, have you dined at home?	Have you had lunch yet?
No, no.	No, I haven’t had lunch.
But all this did I know before.	Everything you told me I already knew.
What says he of our marriage?	What does he say about our marriage?
What of that?	What about that?
My back a' t' other side.	My head is pounding.
Ah, my back, my back!	My back aches too—
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.	Believe me, I’m sorry you’re in pain.
Sweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what says my love?	Sweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what did my love Romeo say?
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous— Where is your mother?	Your love says, like an honorable gentleman, who is courteous, kind, handsome, and, I believe, virtuous— where is your mother?
Where is my mother?	Where is my mother?
Why, she is within.	Why, she’s inside.
Where should she be?	Where else would she be?
How oddly thou repliest!	Your answer is so strange!
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, 'Where is your mother?	Your love says, like an honorable gentleman, 'Where is your mother?
O God’s lady dear, Are you so hot?	Are you this impatient?
Marry, come up, I trow.	Come on, you’re being ridiculous!
Is this the poultice for my aching bones?	Is this the cure for my aching bones?
Henceforward do your messages yourself.	From now on, take care of your messages yourself.
Here’s such a coil.	You’re making such a fuss.
Come, what says Romeo?	Come on, what did Romeo say?
Have you got leave to go to shrift today?	Do you have permission to go out and take confession today?
I have.	I do.
Then hie you hence to Friar Lawrence’s cell.	Then hurry up and rush over to Friar Lawrence’s cell.
There stays a husband to make you a wife.	There’s a husband there who’s waiting to make you his wife.
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks.	Now I see the blood rushing to your cheeks.
They’ll be in scarlet straight at any news.	You blush bright red as soon as you hear any news.
Hie you to church.	Go to the church.
I must another way To fetch a ladder, by the which your love Must climb a bird’s nest soon when it is dark.	Your love will use it to climb up to your window while it’s dark.
Go.	Go.
I’ll to dinner.	I’ll go to lunch.
Hie you to the cell.	You go to Friar Lawrence’s cell.
I do but keep the peace.	I’m only trying to keep the peace.
Put up thy sword, Or manage it to part these men with me.	Either put away your sword or use it to help me stop this fight.
What, drawn, and talk of peace?	What?
I hate the word, As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.	I hate the word peace like I hate hell, all Montagues, and you.
Have at thee, coward!	Let’s go at it, coward!
Clubs, bills, and partisans!	Use your clubs and spears!
Strike!	Hit them!
Beat them down!	Beat them down!
Down with the Capulets!	Down with the Capulets!
Down with the Montagues!	Down with the Montagues!
What noise is this?	What’s this noise?
My sword, I say!	I want my sword.
Old Montague is come, And flourishes his blade in spite of me.	Old Montague is here, and he’s waving his sword around just to make me mad.
Thou villain Capulet!	Capulet, you villain!
Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.	You’re not taking one step toward an enemy.
Hie to high fortune!	Wish me luck.
Honest Nurse, farewell.	Thank you, dear Nurse.
Amen, amen.	Amen, amen.
But come what sorrow can, It cannot countervail the exchange of joy That one short minute gives me in her sight.	But whatever misfortunes occur, they can’t ruin the joy I feel with one look at her.
Therefore love moderately.	Therefore, love each other in moderation.
Long love doth so.	That is the key to long-lasting love.
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.	Too fast is as bad as too slow.
Here comes the lady.	Here comes the lady.
Oh, so light a foot Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint.	Oh,a footstep as light as hers will never endure the rocky road of life.
Good even to my ghostly confessor.	That’s how flimsy and unreal pleasure is.
Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.	Romeo will thank you, my girl, for both of us.
As much to him, else is his thanks too much.	I’ll give him equal thanks, so we’re even.
Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy Be heaped like mine, and that thy skill be more To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath This neighbor air, and let rich music’s tongue Unfold the imagined happiness that both Receive in either by this dear encounter.	Ah, Juliet if you’re as happy as I am, and you’re better with words, tell me about the happiness you imagine we’ll have in our marriage.
Conceit, more rich in matter than in words, Brags of his substance, not of ornament.	I can imagine more than I can say—I have more on my mind than words.
Come, come with me, and we will make short work.	Come, come with me, and we’ll do the job quickly.
I pray thee, good Mercutio, let’s retire.	I’m begging you, good Mercutio, let’s call it a day.
Thou art like one of those fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and says “God send me no need of thee!” and, by the operation of the second cup, draws it on the drawer when indeed there is no need.	You’re like one of those guys who walks into a bar, slams his sword on the table, and then says, “I pray I never have to use you.” By the time he orders his second drink, he pulls his sword on the bartender for no reason at all.
Am I like such a fellow?	Am I really like one of those guys?
Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved.	Come on, you can be as angry as any guy in Italy when you’re in the mood.
And what to?	And what about that?
Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one would kill the other.	If there were two men like you, pretty soon there’d be none because the two of you would kill each other.
Thou, why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast.	You would fight with a man if he had one more whisker or one less whisker in his beard than you have in your beard.
Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes.	You’ll fight with a man who’s cracking nuts just because you have hazelnut-colored eyes.
What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?	Only you would look for a fight like that.
Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarreling.	Your head is as full of fights as an egg is full of yolk, but your head has been beaten like scrambled eggs from so much fighting.
Thou hast quarreled with a man for coughing in the street because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun.	You started a fight with a man who coughed in the street because he woke up a dog that was sleeping in the sun.
Didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter?	Didn’t you argue it out with your tailor for wearing one of his new suits before the right season?
With another, for tying his new shoes with old ribbon?	And with another for tying the new shoes he made with old laces?
And yet thou wilt tutor me from quarreling!	And yet you’re the one who wants to teach me about restraint!
An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.	If I were in the habit of fighting the way you are, my life insurance rates would be sky high.
The fee simple?	Your life insurance?
O simple!	That’s foolish.
By my head, here comes the Capulets.	Oh great, here come the Capulets.
By my heel, I care not.	Well, well, I don’t care.
Couple it with something.	Put it together with something else.
Make it a word and a blow.	Make it a word and a blow.
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me occasion.	You’ll find me ready enough to do that, sir, if you give me a reason.
Could you not take some occasion without giving?	Can’t you find a reason without my giving you one?
Mercutio, thou consort’st with Romeo.	Mercutio, you hang out with Romeo.
What, dost thou make us minstrels?	Hang out?” Who do you think we are, musicians in a band?
An thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords.	If we look like musicians to you, you can expect to hear nothing but noise.
We talk here in the public haunt of men.	We’re talking here in a public place.
Either withdraw unto some private place, And reason coldly of your grievances, Or else depart.	Either go someplace private, or talk it over rationally, or else just go away.
Here all eyes gaze on us.	Out here everybody can see us.
Men’s eyes were made to look and let them gaze.	Men’s eyes were made to see things, so let them watch.
I will not budge for no man’s pleasure, I.	I won’t move to please anybody.
Well, peace be with you, sir.	Well, may peace be with you.
Here comes my man.	Here comes my man, the man I’m looking for.
But I’ll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery.	He’s not your man.
Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee Doth much excuse the appertaining rage To such a greeting.	Tybalt, I have a reason to love you that lets me put aside the rage I should feel and excuse that insult.
Villain am I none.	I am no villain.
Therefore, farewell.	So, goodbye.
I see thou know’st me not.	I can tell that you don’t know who I am.
Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries That thou hast done me.	Boy, your words can’t excuse the harm you’ve done to me.
Therefore turn and draw.	So now turn and draw your sword.
And so, good Capulet—which name I tender As dearly as my own—be satisfied.	And so, good Capulet—which is a name I love like my own name—you should be satisfied with what I say.
O calm dishonourable, vile submission!	This calm submission is dishonorable and vile.
What wouldst thou have with me?	What do you want from me?
Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears?	Will you pull your sword out of its sheath?
Make haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out.	Hurry up, or I’ll smack you on the ears with my sword before you have yours drawn.
I am for you.	I’ll fight you.
Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.	Noble Mercutio, put your sword away.
Away, Tybalt.	Let’s get away, Tybalt.
I am hurt.	I’ve been hurt.
A plague o' both your houses!	May a plague curse both your families.
I am sped.	I’m finished.
Is he gone and hath nothing?	Did he get away clean?
What, art thou hurt?	What, are you hurt?
Marry, ’tis enough.	But it’s enough.
Where is my page?—Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.	Where is my page?
Courage, man.	Have courage, man.
The hurt cannot be much.	The wound can’t be that bad.
No, ’tis not so deep as a well nor so wide as a church-door, but ’tis enough, ’twill serve.	No, it’s not as deep as a well, or as wide as a church door, but it’s enough.
Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a grave man.	Ask for me tomorrow, and you’ll find me in a grave.
I am peppered, I warrant, for this world.	I’m done for in this world, I believe.
A plague o' both your houses!	May a plague strike both your houses.
Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat to scratch a man to death!	I can’t believe that dog, that rat, that mouse, that cat could scratch me to death!
A braggart, a rogue, a villain that fights by the book of arithmetic!	That braggart, punk villain who fights like he learned swordsmanship from a manual!
Why the devil came you between us?	Why the hell did you come in between us?
I was hurt under your arm.	He struck me from under your arm.
I thought all for the best.	I thought it was the right thing to do.
Help me into some house, Benvolio, Or I shall faint.	Take me inside some house, Benvolio, or I’ll pass out.
A plague o' both your houses!	May a plague strike both your families!
They have made worms' meat of me.	They’ve turned me into food for worms.
I have it, And soundly too.	I’m done for.
Your houses!	Curse your families!
O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio is dead!	Oh Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio is dead!
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.	Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
Alive in triumph—and Mercutio slain!	He’s alive and victorious, and Mercutio’s dead?
Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.	Either you, or I, or both of us have to go with him.
Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here Shalt with him hence.	Wretched boy, you hung out with him here, and you’re going to go to heaven with him.
This shall determine that.	This fight will decide who dies.
Romeo, away, be gone!	Romeo, get out of here.
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.	The citizens are around, and Tybalt is dead.
Stand not amazed.	Don’t stand there shocked.
The Prince will doom thee death If thou art taken.	The Prince will give you the death penalty if you get caught.
Hence, be gone, away!	So get out of here!
Why dost thou stay?	Why are you waiting?
Which way ran he that killed Mercutio?	The man who killed Mercutio, which way did he go?
Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?	Tybalt, that murderer, which way did he run?
There lies that Tybalt.	Tybalt is lying over there.
Speak, nephew.	Speak, nephew.
Were you by when it began?	Were you here when it started?
Where are the vile beginners of this fray?	Where are the evil men who started this fight?
O noble prince, I can discover all The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.	Oh, noble prince, I can tell you everything about the unfortunate circumstances of this deadly fight.
There lies the man, slain by young Romeo, That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.	He killed your relative, brave Mercutio, and then young Romeo killed him.
Tybalt, my cousin!	Tybalt was my nephew!
O my brother’s child!	He was my brother’s son!
O cousin, cousin!	Oh cousin, cousin!
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?	Benvolio, who started this fight?
Romeo, he cries aloud, “Hold, friends!	Romeo cried out, “Stop, my friends.
Friends, part!” and, swifter than his tongue, His agile arm beats down their fatal points, And ’twixt them rushes—underneath whose arm An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.	Break it up.” Then he jumped in between them and forced them to put their swords down.
But by and by comes back to Romeo, Who had but newly entertained revenge, And to ’t they go like lightning, for ere I Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain.	Before I could break up the fight, Tybalt was killed.
And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.	Romeo ran away when Tybalt fell dead.
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.	Benvolio is part of the Montague family.
He speaks not true.	He’s not telling the truth.
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife, And all those twenty could but kill one life.	There were twenty Montagues fighting in this awful riot, and together those twenty could only kill one man.
I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give.	You, Prince, are the man who can give me justice.
Romeo slew Tybalt.	Romeo killed Tybalt.
Romeo must not live.	Romeo must die.
Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio.	Romeo killed Tybalt.
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?	Who should now pay the price for Mercutio’s life?
His fault concludes but what the law should end, The life of Tybalt.	His crime did justice’s job by taking Tybalt’s life.
I have an interest in your hearts' proceeding.	I’m involved in your rivalry.
But I’ll amerce you with so strong a fine That you shall all repent the loss of mine.	I’ll punish you so harshly that you’ll regret causing me this loss.
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses.	I won’t listen to your pleas or excuses.
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses, Therefore use none.	You can’t get out of trouble by praying or crying, so don’t bother.
Bear hence this body and attend our will.	Take away this body, and do what I say.
Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.	Showing mercy by pardoning killers only causes more murders.
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites By their own beauties, or, if love be blind, It best agrees with night.	Or else love is blind, and its best time is the night.
Come, civil night, Thou sober-suited matron, all in black, And learn me how to lose a winning match Played for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.	I wish night would come, like a widow dressed in black, so I can learn how to submit to my husband and lose my virginity.
Hood my unmanned blood bating in my cheeks, With thy black mantle, till strange love, grow bold, Think true love acted simple modesty.	Let the blood rushing to my cheeks be calmed.
Come, night.	Come, night.
Come, Romeo.	Come, Romeo.
Come, thou day in night, For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night Whiter than new snow upon a raven’s back.	You’re whiter than snow on the black wings of a raven.
And when I shall die, Take him and cut him out in little stars, And he will make the face of heaven so fine That all the world will be in love with night And pay no worship to the garish sun.	His face will make the heavens so beautiful that the world will fall in love with the night and forget about the garish sun.
The cords That Romeo bid thee fetch?	Is that the rope ladder Romeo told you to pick up?
Ay, ay, the cords.	Yes, yes, this is the rope ladder.
Ay me, what news?	Oh my, what’s the news?
Why dost thou wring thy hands?	Why do you look so upset?
Ah, welladay!	He’s dead.
We are undone, lady, we are undone!	We’re ruined, lady, we’re ruined!
Alack the day!	What an awful day!
Can heaven be so envious?	Can God be so jealous and hateful?
Romeo can, Though heaven cannot.	Romeo is hateful, even though God isn’t.
What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?	What kind of devil are you to torture me like this?
This torture should be roared in dismal hell.	This is as bad as the tortures of hell.
Hath Romeo slain himself?	Has Romeo killed himself?
Say thou but “ay,” And that bare vowel  Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.	Just say “Yes” and I will turn more poisonous than the snake with the evil eye.
I am not I if there be such an  Or those eyes shut that makes thee answer “ay.” If he be slain, say “ay,” or if not, “no.” Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.	If he’s been killed, say “Yes.” If not, say “No.” These short words will determine my joy or my pain.
To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty.	I’ll send my eyes to prison, and they’ll never be free to look at anything again.
Vile earth, to earth resign.	I’ll give my vile body back to the earth.
O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!	Oh, Tybalt, Tybalt, he was the best friend I had.
That ever I should live to see thee dead.	I wish I had not lived long enough to see him die.
Is Romeo slaughtered, and is Tybalt dead?	Has Romeo been killed, and is Tybalt dead too?
My dearest cousin and my dearer lord?	Tybalt was my dearest cousin.
Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banishèd.	Tybalt is dead, and Romeo has been banished.
O God, did Romeo’s hand shed Tybalt’s blood?	Oh God, did Romeo’s hand shed Tybalt’s blood?
It did, it did.	It did, it did.
Alas the day, it did.	Curse the day this happened, but it did.
O serpent heart hid with a flowering face!	Oh, he’s like a snake disguised as a flower.
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?	Did a dragon ever hide in such a beautiful cave?
Dove-feathered raven, wolvish-ravening lamb!	He’s a raven with the feathers of the dove.
O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?	Oh nature, what were you doing in hell?
Was ever book containing such vile matter So fairly bound?	Was there ever such an evil book with such a beautiful cover?
Ah, where’s my man?—Give me some aqua vitae.— These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.	Ah, where’s my servant?—Give me some brandy.—These griefs, these pains, these sorrows make me old.
Shame come to Romeo!	Shame on Romeo!
Blistered be thy tongue For such a wish!	I hope sores cover your tongue for a wish like that!
He was not born to shame.	He was not born to be shameful.
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit, For ’tis a throne where honor may be crowned.	He deserves only honor, complete honor.
Sole monarch of the universal earth, Oh, what a beast was I to chide at him!	Oh, I was such a beast to be angry at him.
Will you speak well of him that killed your cousin?	Are you going to say good things about the man who killed your cousin?
But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?	But why, you villain, did you kill my cousin?
That villain cousin would have killed my husband.	Probably because my cousin the villain would have killed my husband.
All this is comfort.	All this is comforting news.
Wherefore weep I then?	Why, then, should I cry?
I would forget it fain, But oh, it presses to my memory, Like damnèd guilty deeds to sinners' minds.	I would be glad to forget about it, but it weighs on my memory like sins linger in guilty minds.
Tybalt is dead, and Romeo banishèd.”	Tybalt is dead, and Romeo has been banished.”
That “banishèd,” that one word “banishèd” Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts.	That banishment is worse than the murder of ten thousand Tybalts.
Tybalt’s death Was woe enough, if it had ended there.	Tybalt’s death would be bad enough if that was all.
Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship And needly will be ranked with other griefs, Why followed not, when she said “Tybalt’s dead,” “Thy father” or “thy mother,” nay, or both, Which modern lamentations might have moved?	It would have been better if, after she said, “Tybalt’s dead,” she told me my mother or my father, or both, were gone.
But with a rearward following Tybalt’s death, “Romeo is banishèd.” To speak that word, Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet, All slain, all dead.	But to say that Tybalt’s dead and then say, “Romeo has been banished.” To say that is like saying that my father, my mother, Tybalt, Romeo, and Juliet have all been killed, they’re all dead.
Romeo is banishèd.” There is no end, no limit, measure, bound, In that word’s death.	Romeo has been banished.” That news brings infinite death.
No words can that woe sound.	No words can express the pain.
Where is my father and my mother, Nurse?	Where are my father and my mother, Nurse?
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt’s corse.	They are crying and moaning over Tybalt’s corpse.
Will you go to them?	Are you going to join them?
I will bring you thither.	I’ll bring you there.
Wash they his wounds with tears?	Are they washing out his wounds with their tears?
Mine shall be spent When theirs are dry, for Romeo’s banishment.	I’ll cry my tears for Romeo’s banishment when their tears are dry.
Take up those cords.—Poor ropes, you are beguiled, Both you and I, for Romeo is exiled.	Pick up this rope ladder.
He made you for a highway to my bed, But I, a maid, die maiden-widowèd.	He made this rope ladder to be a highway to my bed, but I am a virgin, and I will die a virgin and a widow.
And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!	And death, not Romeo, can take my virginity!
Hie to your chamber.	Go to your bedroom.
I’ll find Romeo To comfort you.	I’ll find Romeo to comfort you.
I wot well where he is.	I know where he is.
Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.	Listen, your Romeo will be here tonight.
I’ll to him.	I’ll go to him.
He is hid at Lawrence' cell.	He’s hiding out in Friar Lawrence’s cell.
Romeo, come forth.	Romeo, come out.
Come forth, thou fearful man.	Come out, you frightened man.
Father, what news?	Father, what’s the news?
Too familiar Is my dear son with such sour company.	You know too much about suffering.
I bring thee tidings of the Prince’s doom.	I have news for you about the Prince’s punishment.
What less than doomsday is the Prince’s doom?	Is the Prince’s punishment any less awful than doomsday?
Ha, banishment!	Ha, banishment?
Be merciful, say “death,” For exile hath more terror in his look, Much more than death.	Be merciful and say “death.” Exile is much worse than death.
Do not say “banishment.” Hence from Verona art thou banishèd.	Don’t say “banishment.” From now on, you are banished from Verona.
Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.	You should be able to endure this because the world is broad and wide.
There is no world without Verona walls But purgatory, torture, hell itself.	There is no world for me outside the walls of Verona, except purgatory, torture, and hell itself.
Hence “banishèd” is banished from the world, And world’s exile is death.	So to be banished from Verona is like being banished from the world, and being banished from the world is death.
Calling death “banishment,” Thou cutt’st my head off with a golden ax And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.	Calling death banishment is like cutting off my head with a golden ax and smiling while I’m being murdered.
O deadly sin!	Oh, deadly sin!
O rude unthankfulness!	Oh, rude and unthankful boy!
Tis torture and not mercy.	It’s torture, not mercy.
More validity, More honorable state, more courtship lives In carrion flies than Romeo.	Flies are healthier and more honorable and better suited for romance than Romeo.
Flies may do this, but I from this must fly.	Flies can kiss her, but I must flee the city.
They are free men, but I am banishèd.	Flies are like free men, but I have been banished.
And sayst thou yet that exile is not death?	And yet you say that exile is not death?
Hadst thou no poison mixed, no sharp-ground knife, No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean, But “banishèd” to kill me?—“Banishèd”!	Did you have no poison, no sharp knife, no weapon you could use to kill me quickly, nothing so disgraceful, except banishment?
O Friar, the damnèd use that word in hell.	Oh Friar, damned souls use the word banishment to describe hell.
Howling attends it.	They howl about banishment.
How hast thou the heart, Being a divine, a ghostly confessor, A sin-absolver, and my friend professed, To mangle me with that word “banishèd”?	If you’re a member of a divine spiritual order of men who forgive sins, and you say you’re my friend, how do you have the heart to mangle me with the word banishment?
Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.	You foolish madman, listen to me for a moment.
Here were the servants of your adversary, And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.	Your servants were fighting your enemy’s servants before I got here.
I drew to part them.	I drew my sword to part them.
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows, Came more and more and fought on part and part, Till the Prince came, who parted either part.	As we were trading blows, more and more people showed up to join the fight, until the Prince came and broke everyone up.
Oh, where is Romeo?	Oh, where’s Romeo?
Saw you him today?	Have you seen him today?
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.	I’m glad he wasn’t here for this fight.
Towards him I made, but he was 'ware of me And stole into the covert of the wood.	I headed toward him, but he saw me coming and hid in the woods.
Many a morning hath he there been seen, With tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew, Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs.	He’s been seen there many mornings, crying tears that add drops to the morning dew and making a cloudy day cloudier with his sighs.
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun Should in the farthest east begin to draw The shady curtains from Aurora’s bed, Away from light steals home my heavy son,	But as soon as the sun rises in the east, my sad son comes home to escape the light.
Oh, thou wilt speak again of banishment.	Oh, you’re just going to talk about banishment again.
Talk no more.	Don’t say anything else.
Oh, then I see that madmen have no ears.	Oh, so madmen like you are also deaf.
How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?	How should madmen hear, if wise men can’t even see?
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.	Let me talk to you about your situation.
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.	You can’t talk about something that you don’t feel.
Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love, An hour but married, Tybalt murderèd, Doting like me, and like me banishèd, Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair And fall upon the ground, as I do now, Taking the measure of an unmade grave.	If you were as young as I am, if you were in love with Juliet, if you had just married her an hour ago, if then you murdered Tybalt, if you were lovesick like me, and if you were banished, then you might talk about it.
Arise.	Get up.
One knocks.	Somebody’s knocking.
Good Romeo, hide thyself.	Hide yourself, good Romeo.
Not I, unless the breath of heartsick groans, Mistlike, infold me from the search of eyes.	I won’t hide unless all the mist from my heartsick groans envelopes me like fog and conceals me from people’s searching eyes.
Who knocks so hard?	Why are you knocking so hard?
Whence come you?	Where do you come from?
What’s your will?	What do you want?
O holy Friar, O, tell me, holy Friar, Where is my lady’s lord?	Oh, holy Friar, Oh, tell me, holy Friar, where is my lady’s husband?
Where’s Romeo?	Where’s Romeo?
Oh, he is even in my mistress' case, Just in her case.	Oh, he’s acting just like Juliet, just like her.
O woeful sympathy, Piteous predicament!	Oh painful sympathy!
Even so lies she, Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.	She’s lying on the ground just like him, blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
Stand, an you be a man.	Stand up if you’re really a man.
For Juliet’s sake, for her sake, rise and stand.	For Juliet’s sake, for her sake, rise and stand up.
Why should you fall into so deep an O?	Why should you fall into so deep a moan?
Nurse!	Nurse!
Ah sir, ah sir.	Ah sir, ah sir.
Death’s the end of all.	Well, death is the end for everybody.
Spakest thou of Juliet?	Were you talking about Juliet?
How is it with her?	How is she?
Where is she?	Where is she?
And how doth she?	How is she doing?
And what says My concealed lady to our canceled love?	What does my hidden wife say about our ruined love?
As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun, Did murder her, as that name’s cursed hand Murdered her kinsman.	She’s calling out my name as if I were a bullet murdering her, just like I murdered her relative.
O, tell me, Friar, tell me, In what vile part of this anatomy Doth my name lodge?	Tell me, Friar, in what part of my body is my name embedded?
Tell me, that I may sack The hateful mansion.	Tell me, so I can cut it out of myself.
Art thou a man?	Are you a man?
Thy wild acts denote The unreasonable fury of a beast.	Your wild actions resemble the irrational fury of a beast.
Thou hast amazed me.	You have amazed me.
By my holy order, I thought thy disposition better tempered.	I swear by my holy order, I thought you were smarter and more rational than this.
Hast thou slain Tybalt?	Have you killed Tybalt?
Why rail’st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?	Why do you complain about your birth, the heavens, and the earth?
Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit, Which, like a usurer, abound’st in all And usest none in that true use indeed Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.	You have so much natural talent, but like someone who hoards money, you use none of your talent for the right purpose—not your body, not your love, not your mind.
What, rouse thee, man!	Get up, man!
Thy Juliet is alive, For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead— There art thou happy.	Your Juliet is alive.
Tybalt would kill thee, But thou slew’st Tybalt—there art thou happy.	Tybalt wanted to kill you, but you killed Tybalt.
The law that threatened death becomes thy friend And turns it to exile—there art thou happy.	Be happy that you’re alive.
A pack of blessings light upon thy back, Happiness courts thee in her best array,	You have the best sorts of happiness to enjoy.
But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench, Thou pout’st upon thy fortune and thy love.	But like a misbehaved, sullen girl, you’re whining about your bad luck and your love.
Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed.	Go be with your love, as it was decided at your wedding.
Ascend her chamber, hence, and comfort her.	Climb up to her bedroom and comfort her.
Commend me to thy lady, And bid her hasten all the house to bed, Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.	Give my regards to your lady, and tell her to hurry everybody in the house to bed.
Romeo is coming.	Romeo is coming.
O Lord, I could have stayed here all the night To hear good counsel.	O Lord, I could stay here all night listening to such good advice.
Oh, what learning is!	Educated men are so impressive!
Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.	Do so, and tell my sweet to be ready to scold me.
Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir.	Here, sir, this is a ring she asked me to give you.
Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.	Hurry up, it’s getting late.
How well my comfort is revived by this!	This makes me feel so much better!
Go hence.	Now get out of here.
Good night.	Good night.
And here stands all your state: Either be gone before the watch be set, Or by the break of day disguised from hence.	Everything depends on this: either be out of here before the night watchmen take their positions, or leave in disguise after daybreak.
Sojourn in Mantua.	Take a little vacation in Mantua.
I’ll find out your man, And he shall signify from time to time Every good hap to you that chances here.	I’ll find your servant, and he’ll update you now and then on your case as it stands here.
Give me thy hand.	Give me your hand.
Tis late.	It’s late.
Farewell.	Farewell.
Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily, That we have had no time to move our daughter.	Things have turned out so unluckily, sir, that we haven’t had time to convince our daughter to marry you.
Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly, And so did I.	Listen, she loved her cousin Tybalt dearly, and so did I.
Well, we were born to die.	Well, we were all born to die.
These times of woe afford no time to woo.	These times of pain are bad times for romance.
Madam, good night.	Madam, good night.
Commend me to your daughter.	Give my regards to your daughter.
I will, and know her mind early tomorrow.	I will.
Tonight she is mewed up to her heaviness.	Tonight she is shut up in her room, alone with her sadness.
Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender Of my child’s love.	Sir Paris, I’ll make a desperate argument for my child’s love.
Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love, And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next— But, soft!	Tell her about my son Paris’s love for her.
What day is this?	And tell her, listen to me, on Wednesday—Wait—What day is today?
Monday, my lord.	Monday, my lord.
Monday!	Monday!
Ha, ha.	Ha, ha!
Do you like this haste?	Do you think it’s a good idea to rush?
We’ll keep no great ado, a friend or two.	We shouldn’t have too big a celebration—we can invite a friend or two.
For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late, It may be thought we held him carelessly, Being our kinsman, if we revel much.	Listen, because Tybalt was just killed, people might think that we don’t care about his memory as our relative if we have too grand a party.
Therefore we’ll have some half a dozen friends, And there an end.	Therefore we’ll have about half a dozen friends to the wedding, and that’s it.
But what say you to Thursday?	What do you think about Thursday?
My lord, I would that Thursday were tomorrow.	My lord, I wish Thursday were tomorrow.
Well get you gone.	Well go on home.
O' Thursday be it, then.— Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed.	Thursday it is, then.
Wilt thou be gone?	Are you going?
It is not yet near day.	It’s still a long time until daybreak.
It was the nightingale, and not the lark, That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear.	That sound you heard was the  It was the lark, the bird that sings at dawn, not the nightingale.
Look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east.	Look, my love, what are those streaks of light in the clouds parting in the east?
Night’s candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.	Night is over, and day is coming.
Yon light is not daylight, I know it, I.	That light is not daylight, I know it.
It is some meteor that the sun exhales To be to thee this night a torchbearer, And light thee on thy way to Mantua.	It’s some meteor coming out of the sun to light your way to Mantua.
Therefore stay yet.	So stay for a while.
Thou need’st not to be gone.	You don’t have to go yet.
Let me be ta'en.	Let me be captured.
Let me be put to death.	Let me be put to death.
I am content, so thou wilt have it so.	I am content, if that’s the way you want it.
I have more care to stay than will to go.	I want to stay more than I want to go.
Come, death, and welcome!	Come, death, and welcome!
Let’s talk.	Let’s talk.
It is not day.	It’s not daylight.
It is, it is.	It is, it is.
It is the lark that sings so out of tune, Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.	It’s the lark that sings so out of tune, making such harsh noise.
Some say the lark makes sweet division.	Some say the lark makes a sweet division between day and night.
This doth not so, for she divideth us.	It’s not true because she separates us.
More light and light it grows.	More and more light.
More light and light, more dark and dark our woes!	More and more pain for us.
Madam.	Madam.
Nurse?	Nurse?
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.	Your mother is coming to your bedroom.
The day is broke.	Day has broken.
Then, window, let day in and let life out.	Then the window lets day in, and life goes out the window.
Farewell, farewell.	Farewell, farewell!
One kiss, and I’ll descend.	Give me one kiss, and I’ll go down.
And private in his chamber pens himself, Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out, And makes himself an artificial night.	He locks himself up alone in his bedroom, shuts his windows to keep out the beautiful daylight, and makes himself an artificial night.
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?	My noble uncle, do you know why he acts this way?
I neither know it nor can learn of him.	I don’t know, and he won’t tell me.
Have you importuned him by any means?	Have you done everything you could to make him tell you the reason?
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay To hear true shrift.—Come, madam, let’s away.	I hope you’re lucky enough to hear the true story by sticking around.
Art thou gone so, love, lord?	Are you gone like that, my love, my lord?
Oh, by this count I shall be much in years Ere I again behold my Romeo.	Oh, by this count I’ll be many years older before I see my Romeo again.
Farewell!	Farewell!
I will omit no opportunity That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.	I won’t miss any chance to send my love to you.
Oh, think’st thou we shall ever meet again?	Oh, do you think we’ll ever meet again?
O God, I have an ill-divining soul.	Oh God, I have a soul that predicts evil things!
Methinks I see thee now, thou art so low As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.	Now that you are down there, you look like someone dead in the bottom of a tomb.
Either my eyesight fails, or thou look’st pale.	Either my eyesight is failing me, or you look pale.
And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.	And trust me, love, you look pale to me too.
Dry sorrow drinks our blood.	Sadness takes away our color.
Adieu, adieu!	Goodbye, Goodbye!
O fortune, fortune!	Oh luck, luck.
All men call thee fickle.	Everyone says you can’t make up your mind.
Be fickle, fortune, For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long, But send him back.	I hope maybe then you’ll send him back home soon.
Who is ’t that calls?	Who’s that calling?
Is it my lady mother?	Is it my mother?
What unaccustomed cause procures her hither?	What strange reason could she have for coming here?
Why, how now, Juliet?	What’s going on, Juliet?
Madam, I am not well.	Madam, I am not well.
Evermore weeping for your cousin’s death?	Will you cry about your cousin’s death forever?
What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?	Are you trying to wash him out of his grave with tears?
An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.	If you could, you couldn’t bring him back to life.
Therefore, have done.	So stop crying.
Some grief shows much of love, But much of grief shows still some want of wit.	A little bit of grief shows a lot of love.
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.	Let me keep weeping for such a great loss.
So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend Which you weep for.	You will feel the loss, but the man you weep for will feel nothing.
Feeling so the loss, Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.	Feeling the loss like this, I can’t help but weep for him forever.
Well, girl, thou weep’st not so much for his death, As that the villain lives which slaughtered him.	Well, girl, you’re weeping not for his death as much as for the fact that the villain who killed him is still alive.
What villain, madam?	What villain, madam?
That same villain, Romeo.	That villain, Romeo.
That is because the traitor murderer lives.	That’s because the murderer is alive.
Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.	Yes, madam, he lies beyond my reach.
Would none but I might venge my cousin’s death!	I wish that no one could avenge my cousin’s death except me!
Then weep no more.	Stop crying.
I’ll send to one in Mantua, Where that same banished runagate doth live, Shall give him such an unaccustomed dram That he shall soon keep Tybalt company.	I’ll send a man to Mantua, where that exiled rogue is living.
And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.	And then, I hope, you’ll be satisfied.
Indeed, I never shall be satisfied With Romeo, till I behold him—dead— Is my poor heart for a kinsman vexed.	I’ll never be satisfied with Romeo until I see him .
Madam, if you could find out but a man To bear a poison, I would temper it, That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof, Soon sleep in quiet.	Madam, if you can find a man to deliver the poison, I’ll mix it myself so that Romeo will sleep quietly soon after he drinks it.
To wreak the love I bore my cousin Upon his body that slaughtered him!	I want to take the love I had for my cousin and take it out on the body of the man who killed him.
Find thou the means, and I’ll find such a man.	Find out the way, and I’ll find the right man.
But now I’ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.	But now I have joyful news for you, girl.
And joy comes well in such a needy time.	And it’s good to have joy in such a joyless time.
What are they, beseech your ladyship?	Please tell me.
Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child.	Well, well, you have a careful father, child.
Madam, in happy time, what day is that?	Madam, tell me quickly, what day is that?
Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn, The gallant, young, and noble gentleman, The County Paris, at Saint Peter’s Church, Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.	Indeed, my child, at Saint Peter’s Church early Thursday morning, the gallant, young, and noble gentleman Count Paris will happily make you a joyful bride.
Now, by Saint Peter’s Church and Peter too, He shall not make me there a joyful bride.	Now, I swear by Saint Peter’s Church and Peter too, he will not make me a joyful bride there.
I wonder at this haste, that I must wed Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.	How can I marry him, this husband, before he comes to court me?
I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam, I will not marry yet.	Please, tell my father, madam, I won’t marry yet.
And when I do, I swear It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate, Rather than Paris.	And, when I do marry, I swear, it will be Romeo, whom you know I hate, rather than Paris.
These are news indeed!	That’s really news!
Here comes your father.	Here comes your father.
Tell him so yourself, And see how he will take it at your hands.	Tell him so yourself, and see how he takes the news.
How now?	What are you, girl?
A conduit, girl?	Some kind of fountain?
What, still in tears, Evermore showering?	Why are you still crying?
Have you delivered to her our decree?	Have you told her our decision?
I would the fool were married to her grave!	I wish the fool were dead and married to her grave!
How, will she none?	How can this be?
Is she not proud?	Isn’t she proud of such a match?
Doth she not count her blessed, Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought So worthy a gentleman to be her bride?	Doesn’t she realize how unworthy she is of the gentleman we have found to be her bridegroom?
Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.	But I am thankful that you have found it.
How, how, how, how?	What is this?
Chopped logic!	What is this fuzzy logic?
What is this?	What is this?
Proud,” and “I thank you,” and “I thank you not,” And yet “not proud”?	I hear you say “proud” and “I thank you,” and then “no thank you” and “not proud,” you spoiled little girl.
Out, you green sickness, carrion!	You disgust me, you little bug!
Out, you baggage!	You worthless girl!
You tallow face!	You pale face!
Fie, fie!	Shame on you!
What, are you mad?	What, are you crazy?
Good Father, I beseech you on my knees, Hear me with patience but to speak a word.	Good father, I’m begging you on my knees, be patient and listen to me say just one thing.
Speak not.	Don’t say anything.
Reply not.	Don’t reply.
Do not answer me.	Don’t talk back to me.
Out on her, hilding!	She disgusts me, the little hussy!
God in heaven bless her!	God in heaven bless her!
You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.	My lord, you’re wrong to berate her like that.
And why, my Lady Wisdom?	And why, wise lady?
Smatter with your gossips, go.	Go blabber with your gossiping friends.
I speak no treason.	I’ve said nothing wrong.
Oh, God 'i' good e'en.	Oh, for God’s sake.
May not one speak?	Can’t I say something?
Peace, you mumbling fool!	Be quiet, you mumbling fool!
Utter your gravity o'er a gossip’s bowl, For here we need it not.	We don’t need to hear it.
You are too hot.	You’re getting too angry.

It makes me mad.	It makes me mad.
Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play, Alone, in company, still my care hath been To have her matched.	Day and night, hour after hour, all the time, at work, at play, alone, in company, my top priority has always been to find her a husband.

An you be mine, I’ll give you to my friend.	If you act like my daughter, I’ll marry you to my friend.

I’ll not be forsworn.	I won’t break this promise.
Delay this marriage for a month, a week.	Delay this marriage for a month, or a week.
Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.	Or, if you don’t delay, make my wedding bed in the tomb where Tybalt lies.
Talk not to me, for I’ll not speak a word.	Don’t talk to me, because I won’t say a word.
Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.	Do as you please, because I’m done worrying about you.
O God!—O Nurse, how shall this be prevented?	Oh God!—Oh Nurse, how can this be stopped?
My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.	My husband is alive on earth, my vows of marriage are in heaven.
How shall that faith return again to earth, Unless that husband send it me from heaven By leaving earth?	How can I bring those promises back down to earth, unless my husband sends them back down to me by dying and going to heaven?
Comfort me.	Give me comfort.
Hast thou not a word of joy?	Don’t you have one word of joy?
Some comfort, Nurse.	Give me some comfort, Nurse.
Oh, he’s a lovely gentleman.	Oh, he’s a lovely gentleman!

An eagle, madam, Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye As Paris hath.	Madam, an eagle does not have eyes as green, as quick, and as fair as the eyes of Paris.
Beshrew my very heart, I think you are happy in this second match, For it excels your first.	Curse my very heart, but I think you should be happy in this second marriage, because it’s better than your first.
Or if it did not, Your first is dead, or ’twere as good he were, As living here and you no use of him.	Even if it’s not better, your first marriage is over.
Speakest thou from thy heart?	Are you speaking from your heart?
Amen!	Amen!
What?	What?

Go in, and tell my lady I am gone, Having displeased my father, to Lawrence’s cell To make confession and to be absolved.	I made my father angry, so I went to Friar Lawrence’s cell to confess and be forgiven.
Marry, I will, and this is wisely done.	Alright, I will.
O most wicked fiend!	Oh, that most wicked fiend!
I’ll to the friar to know his remedy.	I’m going to the Friar to find out his solution.
If all else fail, myself have power to die.	If everything else fails, at least I have the power to take my own life.
On Thursday, sir?	On Thursday, sir?
The time is very short.	That’s very soon.
You say you do not know the lady’s mind.	You say you don’t know what the girl thinks.
I like it not.	I don’t like it.
Now do you know the reason of this haste.	Now you know the reason for the rush.
Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.	Look, sir, here comes the lady walking toward my cell.

That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.	That might be the case sir,
Good morrow, cousin.	Good morning, cousin.
Is the day so young?	Is it that early in the day?
But new struck nine.	It’s only just now nine o'clock.
Was that my father that went hence so fast?	Was that my father who left here in such a hurry?
It was.	It was.
Not having that which, having, makes them short.	I don’t have the thing that makes time fly.
In love?	You’re in love?
Out.	Out.
Of love?	Out of love?
Where shall we dine?—O me!	So, where should we eat?
That “may be” must be, love, on Thursday next.	That “may be” must be, love, on Thursday.
What must be shall be.	What must be will be.
That’s a certain text.	That is a certain truth.
Come you to make confession to this Father?	Have you come to make confession to this father?
To answer that, I should confess to you.	If I answered that question, I’d be making confession to you.
Do not deny to him that you love me.	Don’t deny to him that you love me.
I will confess to you that I love him.	I’ll confess to you that I love him.
So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.	You will also confess, I’m sure, that you love me.
If I do so, it will be of more price Being spoke behind your back than to your face.	If I do so, it will mean more if I say it behind your back than if I say it to your face.
Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.	You poor soul, your face has suffered many tears.
Thy face is mine, and thou hast slandered it.	Your face is mine, and you have slandered it.
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.— My lord, we must entreat the time alone.	I have time for you now, my sad daughter.
God shield I should disturb devotion!— Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.	God forbid that I should prevent sacred devotion!
O Juliet, I already know thy grief.	Oh, Juliet, I already know about your sad situation.
I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it, On Thursday next be married to this county.	I hear that you must marry this count on Thursday, and that nothing can delay it.

Let not the Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.	Don’t let the Nurse stay with you in your bedroom.

Love give me strength, and strength shall help afford.	Love will give me strength, and strength will help me accomplish this plan.
Farewell, dear Father.	Goodbye, dear Father.
You shall have none ill, sir, for I’ll try if they can lick their fingers.	You won’t get any bad cooks from me.
How canst thou try them so?	How can you test them like that?
Therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me.	So the cooks who can’t lick their fingers aren’t hired.

A sick man in sadness makes his will, A word ill urged to one that is so ill.	You wouldn’t tell a sick man he “seriously” has to make his will—it would just make him worse.

Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while, Till we can clear these ambiguities And know their spring, their head, their true descent, And then will I be general of your woes, And lead you even to death.	And then I’ll be the leader of pain, and maybe I’ll lead you as far as death.
Meantime forbear, And let mischance be slave to patience.— Bring forth the parties of suspicion.	In the meantime, hold on, and be patient.
I am the greatest, able to do least, Yet most suspected, as the time and place Doth make against me, of this direful murder.	I am the greatest, but I was able to do the least.
And here I stand, both to impeach and purge, Myself condemnèd and myself excused.	I have already condemned and excused myself.
Then say at once what thou dost know in this.	Tell us what you know about this affair.
I will be brief, for my short date of breath Is not so long as is a tedious tale.	I will be brief because I’m not going to live long enough to tell a boring story.
Meantime I writ to Romeo, That he should hither come as this dire night, To help to take her from her borrowed grave, Being the time the potion’s force should cease.	In the meantime I wrote to Romeo and told him to come here on this awful night to help remove her from her temporary grave when the sleeping potion wore off.
What can he say in this?	I know all of this.
Their course of love, the tidings of her death.	I brought my master news of Juliet’s death.
Montague!	Give me the letter.
O brother Montague, give me thy hand.	Oh, brother Montague, give me your hand.
But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?	But what do you say to my request?
But saying o'er what I have said before.	I can only repeat what I’ve said before.
My child is yet a stranger in the world.	My daughter is still very young.
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years.	She’s not even fourteen years old.
Younger than she are happy mothers made.	Girls younger than she often marry and become happy mothers.
And too soon marred are those so early made.	Girls who marry so young grow up too soon.
But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart.	But go ahead and charm her, gentle Paris; make her love you.
This night I hold an old accustomed feast, Whereto I have invited many a guest Such as I love.	Tonight I’m having a feast that we’ve celebrated for many years.
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life, Whose misadventured piteous overthrows Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.	At my humble house tonight, you can expect to see dazzling stars that walk on the ground and light the sky from below.
The fearful passage of their death-marked love And the continuance of their parents' rage, Which, but their children’s end, naught could remove, Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage— The which, if you with patient ears attend, What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.	In the beautiful city of Verona, where our story takes place, a long-standing hatred between two families erupts into new violence, and citizens stain their hands with the blood of their fellow citizens.
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel When well-appareled April on the heel Of limping winter treads.	Two unlucky children of these enemy families become lovers and commit suicide.
Even such delight Among fresh fennel buds shall you this night Inherit at my house.	Their unfortunate deaths put an end to their parents' feud.
Go, sirrah, trudge about Through fair Verona.	Come along with me.
Find them out whose names are written here?	Find the people whose names are on this list?
It is written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last, the fisher with his pencil and the painter with his nets.	It is written that shoemakers and tailors should play with each others' tools, that fisherman should play with paints, and painters should play with with fishing nets.
But I am sent to find those persons whose names are here writ, and can never find what names the writing person hath here writ.	But I’ve been sent to find the people whose names are written on this list, and I can’t read!
Take thou some new infection to thy eye, And the rank poison of the old will die.	But here come some people, right in the nick of time.
Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.	For when you cut your shin.
For what, I pray thee?	What?
Why Romeo, art thou mad?	Romeo, are you crazy?
Not mad, but bound more than a madman is, Shut up in prison, kept without my food, Whipped and tormented and—Good e'en, good fellow.	I’m locked up in a prison and deprived of food.
God 'i' good e'en.	I’m whipped and tortured— May God give you a good evening.
I pray, sir, can you read?	Excuse me, sir, do you know how to read?
Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.	I can read my own fortune in my misery.
Perhaps you have learned it without book.	Perhaps you’ve learned from life and not from books.
But I pray, can you read anything you see?	But please tell me, can you read anything you see?
Ay, if I know the letters and the language.	Yes, if I know the language and the letters.
Ye say honestly.	I see.
Stay, fellow.	Well, that’s an  Stay, fellow.
I can read.	I can read.
Seigneur Martino and his wife and daughters; County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; The lady widow of Vitruvio; Seigneur Placentio and his lovely nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; Mine uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; My fair niece Rosaline and Livia;	Signor Martino and his wife and daughters, Count Anselme and his beautiful sisters, Vitruvio’s widow, Signor Placentio and his lovely nieces, Mercutio and his brother Valentine, My uncle Capulet and his wife and daughters, My fair niece Rosaline and Livia,
Seigneur Valentio and his cousin Tybalt; Lucio and the lively Helena.” A fair assembly.	Signor Valentio and his cousin Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.” That’s a nice group of people.
Whither should they come?	Where are they supposed to come?
Up.	Up.
Whither?	Where?
To supper?	To supper?
To our house.	To our house.
Whose house?	Whose house?
My master’s.	My master’s house.
Indeed, I should have asked thee that before.	Indeed, I should have asked you before who he was.
Now I’ll tell you without asking.	Now I’ll tell you so you don’t have to ask.
My master is the great rich Capulet, and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray come and crush a cup of wine.	My master is the great and rich Capulet, and if you don’t belong to the house of Montague, please come and drink a cup of wine.
Rest you merry!	Have a nice day!
At this same ancient feast of Capulet’s Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so loves With all the admired beauties of Verona.	The beautiful Rosaline whom you love so much will be at Capulet’s traditional feast, along with every beautiful woman in Verona.
Go thither, and with unattainted eye Compare her face with some that I shall show, And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.	Go there and compare her objectively to some other girls I’ll show you.
One fairer than my love?	A woman more beautiful than the one I love?
The all-seeing sun Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.	The sun itself has never seen anyone as beautiful since the world began.
I’ll go along, no such sight to be shown, But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.	I’ll go with you.
Nurse, where’s my daughter?	Nurse, where’s my daughter?
Call her forth to me.	Tell her to come to me.
Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old I bade her come.	I swear to you by my virginity at age twelve, I already told her to come.
What, lamb!	Come on!
How now, who calls?	Who’s calling me?
Your mother.	Your mother.
Madam, I am here.	Madam, I’m here.
What is your will?	What do you want?
Thou know’st my daughter’s of a pretty age.	You know how young my daughter is.
Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.	Yes, I know her age down to the hour.
She’s not fourteen.	She’s not even fourteen.
I’ll lay fourteen of my teeth—and yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four—she is not fourteen.	I’d bet fourteen of my own teeth—but, I’m sorry to say, I only have four teeth—she’s not fourteen.
Even or odd, of all days in the year, Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.	Whether it’s even or odd, of all the days in the year, on the night of Lammas Eve, she’ll be fourteen.
Susan and she—God rest all Christian souls!— Were of an age.	She and Susan—God rest her and all Christian souls—were born on the same day.
Well, Susan is with God.	Well, Susan died and is with God.
She was too good for me.	She was too good for me.
But, as I said, On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.	But like I said, on the night of Lammas Eve, she will be fourteen.
That shall she.	Yes, she will.
Marry, I remember it well.	Indeed, I remember it well.
Tis since the earthquake now eleven years, And she was weaned—I never shall forget it— Of all the days of the year, upon that day.	It’s been eleven years since the earthquake.
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug, Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.	I had put bitter wormwood on my breast as I was sitting in the sun, under the wall of the dovehouse.
My lord and you were then at Mantua.— Nay, I do bear a brain.—But, as I said, When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool, To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!	But like I said, when she tasted the bitter wormwood on my nipple, the pretty little babe got irritated and started to quarrel with my breast.
Shake!” quoth the dovehouse.	Then the dovehouse shook with the earthquake.
Twas no need, I trow, To bid me trudge.	There was no need to tell me to get out of there.
Yea,” quoth he, “Dost thou fall upon thy face?	Oh,” he said, “Did you fall on your face?
And, pretty fool, it stinted and said “ay.” Enough of this.	You’ll  Enough of this.
I pray thee, hold thy peace.	Please be quiet.
Yes, madam.	Yes ,madam.
Yet I cannot choose but laugh To think it should leave crying and say “ay.” And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow A bump as big as a young cockerel’s stone, A perilous knock, and it cried bitterly.	But I can’t help laughing to think that the baby stopped crying and said, “Yes.” I swear, she had a bump on her forehead as big as a rooster’s testicle.
Yea,” quoth my husband, “Fall’st upon thy face?	It was a painful bruise, and she was crying bitterly.
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age.	Yes,” said my husband, “Did you fall on your face?
Wilt thou not, Jule?” It stinted and said “ay.” And stint thou too, I pray thee, Nurse, say I.	You’ll fall backward when you grow up, won’t you, Jule?” And she stopped crying and said, “Yes.” Now you stop too, Nurse, please.
God mark thee to his grace!	May God choose you to receive his grace.
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.	You were the prettiest baby I ever nursed.
An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.	If I live to see you get married someday, all my wishes will come true.
Tell me, daughter Juliet, How stands your disposition to be married?	Tell me, my daughter Juliet, what is your attitude about getting married?
It is an honor that I dream not of.	It is an honor that I do not dream of.
Well, think of marriage now.	Well, start thinking about marriage now.
Younger than you Here in Verona, ladies of esteem Are made already mothers.	Here in Verona there are girls younger than you—girls from noble families—who have already become mothers.
By my count, I was your mother much upon these years That you are now a maid.	By my count, I was already your mother at just about your age, while you remain a virgin.
Thus then in brief: The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.	Well then, I’ll say this quickly: the valiant Paris wants you as his bride.
A man, young lady!	What a man, young lady.
Verona’s summer hath not such a flower.	Summertime in Verona has no flower as fine as him.
What say you?	Lose nothing?
I’ll look to like if looking liking move.	I’ll look at him and try to like him, at least if what I see is likable.
But no more deep will I endart mine eye Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.	But I won’t let myself fall for him any more than your permission allows.
I must hence to wait.	Everything’s out of control.
I beseech you, follow straight.	Please, follow straight after me.
We follow thee.—Juliet, the county stays.	We’ll follow you.
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.	Go, girl, look for a man who’ll give you happy nights at the end of happy days.
What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?	What will we say is our excuse for being here?
Or shall we on without apology?	Or should we enter without apologizing?
The date is out of such prolixity.	It’s out of fashion to give lengthy explanations like that.
But let them measure us by what they will.	Let them judge us however they please.
Give me a torch.	Give me a torch.
I am not for this ambling.	I don’t want to dance.
Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.	No, noble Romeo, you’ve got to dance.
Not I, believe me.	Not me, believe me.
You have dancing shoes With nimble soles.	You’re wearing dancing shoes with nimble soles.
I have a soul of lead So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.	My soul is made out of lead, and it’s so heavy it keeps me stuck on the ground so I can’t move.
You are a lover.	You’re a lover.
Borrow Cupid’s wings And soar with them above a common bound.	Take Cupid’s wings and fly higher than the average man.
I am too sore enpiercèd with his shaft To soar with his light feathers, and so bound, I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.	His arrow has pierced me too deeply, so I can’t fly high with his cheerful feathers.
Under love’s heavy burden do I sink.	I sink under the heavy weight of love.
I mean, an we be in choler, we’ll draw.	We won’t take their garbage.
I strike quickly, being moved.	I hit hard when I’m angry.
But thou art not quickly moved to strike.	Angry enough to run away.
To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.	You won’t stand and fight.
A dog of that house shall move me to stand.	A dog from that house will make me angry enough to take a stand.
And to sink in it, should you burthen love— Too great oppression for a tender thing.	If you sink, you’re dragging love down.
Is love a tender thing?	Is love really tender?
It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.	I think it’s too rough, too rude, too rowdy, and it pricks like a thorn.
If love be rough with you, be rough with love.	If love plays rough with you, play rough with  Come on, let’s knock and go in.
Let wantons light of heart Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels.	Let playful people with light hearts dance.
Come, we burn daylight, ho!	Come on, we’re wasting precious daylight.
Nay, that’s not so.	Let’s go!
We waste our lights in vain, like lights by day.	No we’re not—it’s night.
And we mean well in going to this mask, But ’tis no wit to go.	We mean well by going to this masquerade ball, but it’s not smart of us to go.
Why, may one ask?	Why, may I ask?
I dreamt a dream tonight.	I had a dream last night.
And so did I.	So did I.
Well, what was yours?	Well, what was your dream?
That dreamers often lie.	My dream told me that dreamers often lie.
In bed asleep while they do dream things true.	They lie in bed while they dream about the truth.
Oh, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.	Oh, then I see you’ve been with  Who’s Queen Mab?
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier’s nose, And then dreams he of smelling out a suit.	Sometimes she rides over a courtier’s lips, and he dreams of making money off of someone.
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail Tickling a parson’s nose as he lies asleep, Then he dreams of another benefice.	Sometimes she tickles a priest’s nose with a  Enough, enough!
This is she—    Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!	Mercutio, be quiet.
This wind you talk of, blows us from ourselves.	The wind you’re talking about is blowing us off our course.
Supper is done, and we shall come too late.	Dinner is over, and we’re going to get there too late.
On, lusty gentlemen.	Onward, lover boys!
Strike, drum.	Beat the drum.
Where’s Potpan, that he helps not to take away?	Where’s Potpan?
When good manners shall lie all in one or two men’s hands, and they unwashed too, ’tis a foul thing.	When only one or two men have all the good manners, and even they are dirty, things are bad.
Away with the joint-stools, remove the court-cupboard, look to the plate.	Take away the stools, the sideboards, and the plates.
Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane, and, as thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.—Antony and Potpan!	You, good friend, save me a piece of marzipan, and if you love me, have the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
Ay, boy, ready.	Yes, boy, I’m ready.
You are looked for and called for, asked for and sought for, in the great chamber.	They’re looking for you in the great chamber.
We cannot be here and there too.	We can’t be in two places at once, both here and there!
Cheerly, boys.	Cheers, boys.
Be brisk 0awhile, and the longer liver take all.	Be quick for a while and let the one who lives the longest take everything.
Welcome, gentlemen!	Welcome, gentlemen.

By'r Lady, thirty years.	I swear, it must be thirty years.
Tis more, ’tis more.	It’s been longer, it’s been longer.
His son is elder, sir.	Lucentio’s son is older than that, sir.
His son is thirty.	He’s thirty years old.
Will you tell me that?	Are you really going to tell me that?
His son was but a ward two years ago.	His son was a minor only two years ago.
I know not, sir.	I don’t know, sir.
Oh, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!	Oh, she shows the torches how to burn bright!
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.	My eyes were liars, then, because I never saw true beauty before tonight.
This, by his voice, should be a Montague.—   What, dares the slave Come hither, covered with an antic face, To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?	I can tell by his voice that this man is a Montague.
Wherefore storm you so?	Why are you acting so angry?
Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe, A villain that is hither come in spite To scorn at our solemnity this night.	Uncle, this man is a Montague—our enemy.
Young Romeo is it?	Is it young Romeo?
Tis he, that villain Romeo.	That’s him, that villain Romeo.
Content thee, gentle coz.	Calm down, gentle cousin.
Let him alone.	Leave him alone.
He bears him like a portly gentleman, And, to say truth, Verona brags of him To be a virtuous and well-governed youth.	He carries himself like a dignified gentleman, and, to tell you the truth, he has a reputation throughout Verona as a virtuous and well-behaved young man.
I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement.	I wouldn’t insult him in my own house for all the wealth in this town.
Therefore be patient.	So calm down.
Take no note of him.	Just ignore him.
You’ll not endure him!	I won’t tolerate him.
Why, uncle, ’tis a shame.	You  But, uncle, we’re being disrespected.
Go to, go to.	Go on, go on.
You are a saucy boy.	You’re an insolent little boy.
Is ’t so, indeed?	Is that how it is, really?
This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what.	I know what I’ll do.
You must contrary me.	You have to contradict me, do you?
I’ll make you quiet.—What, cheerly, my hearts!	I’ll teach you a lesson.
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?	Don’t saints and pilgrims have lips too?
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.	Yes, pilgrim—they have lips that they’re supposed to pray with.
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do.	Well then, saint, let lips do what hands do.
They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.	Please grant my prayer so my faith doesn’t turn to despair.
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.	Saints don’t move, even when they grant prayers.
Then move not, while my prayer’s effect I take.	Then don’t move while I act out my prayer.
Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purged.	Now my sin has been taken from my lips by yours.
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.	Then do my lips now have the sin they took from yours?
Sin from thy lips?	Sin from my lips?
Give me my sin again.	Give me my sin back.
You kiss by th' book.	You kiss like you’ve studied how.

What is her mother?	Who is her mother?
I nursed her daughter that you talked withal.	I nursed her daughter, whom you were just talking to.
I tell you, he that can lay hold of her Shall have the chinks.	Let me tell you, the man who marries her will become very wealthy.
Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone.	No gentlemen, don’t get ready to go now.
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.— Is it e'en so?	We have a little dessert coming up.

The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.	The fight is between our masters, and we men who work for them.

Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.	You mean their  Cut off their heads, take their maidenheads—whatever.
Take it in what sense thou wilt.	Take my remark in whichever sense you like.

The strangers all are gone.	The strangers are all gone.
Now Romeo is beloved and loves again, Alike bewitchèd by the charm of looks, But to his foe supposed he must complain, And she steal love’s sweet bait from fearful hooks.	But he has to make his speeches of love to a woman who’s supposed to be his enemy.
And she as much in love, her means much less To meet her new beloved anywhere.	And Juliet’s just as much in love as he, but she has even less opportunity to meet her lover.
But passion lends them power, time means, to meet, Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.	But love gives them power, and time gives them the chance to meet, sweetening the extreme danger with intense pleasure.
Can I go forward when my heart is here?	Can I go away while my heart stays here?
He is wise, And, on my life, hath stol'n him home to bed.	I bet he slipped away and went home to bed.
He ran this way and leapt this orchard wall.	He ran this way and jumped over this orchard wall.

Nay, I’ll conjure too!	I’ll conjure him as if I were summoning a spirit.
Romeo!	Romeo!
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh!	Show yourself in the form of a sigh.
Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied.	Speak one rhyme, and I’ll be satisfied.
Cry but “Ay me!” Pronounce but “love” and “dove.” Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word, One nickname for her purblind son and heir, Young Abraham Cupid, he that shot so true When King Cophetua loved the beggar maid.— He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not.	Just cry out, “Ah me!” Just say “love” and “dove.” Say just one lovely word to my good friend
An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.	If he hears you, you’ll make him angry.
This cannot anger him.	What I’m saying can’t anger him.
My invocation Is fair and honest.	The things I’m saying are fair and honest.
Blind is his love and best befits the dark.	His love is blind, so it belongs in the dark.
If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.	If love is blind, it can’t hit the target.
Now will he sit under a medlar tree And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.— O Romeo, that she were!	Now he’ll sit under a  Let’s go.
Go, then, for ’tis in vain To seek him here that means not to be found.	There’s no point in looking for him if he doesn’t want to be found.
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.	It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
Her vestal livery is but sick and green, And none but fools do wear it.	Virginity makes her look sick and green.
Cast it off!	Let it go.
It is my lady.	Oh, there’s my lady!
Oh, it is my love.	Oh, it is my love.
Oh, that she knew she were!	Oh, I wish she knew how much I love her.
She speaks, yet she says nothing.	She’s talking, but she’s not saying anything.
What of that?	So what?
Her eye discourses.	Her eyes are saying something.
Tis not to me she speaks.	She’s not talking to me.
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven, Having some business, do entreat her eyes To twinkle in their spheres till they return.	Two of the brightest stars in the whole sky had to go away on business, and they’re asking her eyes to twinkle in their places until they return.
Her eye in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night.	If her eyes were in the night sky, they would shine so brightly through space that birds would start singing, thinking her light was the light of day.
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand.	Look how she leans her hand on her cheek.
Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand That I might touch that cheek!	Oh, I wish I was the glove on that hand so that I could touch that cheek.
O Romeo, Romeo!	Oh, my!
Wherefore art thou Romeo?	Who are you?
Tis but thy name that is my enemy.	I hate my name, dear saint, because my name is your enemy.
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.	Aren’t you Romeo?
What man art thou that, thus bescreened in night, So stumblest on my counsel?	And aren’t you a Montague?
By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am.	Tell me, how did you get in here?
Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?	And why did you come?
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.	If any of my relatives find you here they’ll kill you because of who you are.
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.	Therefore your relatives are no obstacle.
If they do see thee they will murder thee.	If they see you, they’ll murder you.
Look thou but sweet, And I am proof against their enmity.	Just look at me kindly, and I’m invincible against their hatred.
I would not for the world they saw thee here.	I’d give anything to keep them from seeing you here.
My life were better ended by their hate Than death proroguèd, wanting of thy love.	I’d rather they killed me than have to live without your love.
Thou know’st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.	Otherwise, you’d see me blushing about the things you’ve heard me say tonight.
Dost thou love me?	Do you love me?
I know thou wilt say “ay,” And I will take thy word.	I know you’ll say “yes,” and I’ll believe you.
What shall I swear by?	What should I swear by?
Do not swear at all.	Don’t swear at all.
Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I’ll believe thee.	But if you have to swear, swear by your wonderful self, which is the god I worship like an idol, and then I’ll believe you.
If my heart’s dear love— Well, do not swear.	If my heart’s dear love— Well, don’t swear.
Although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract tonight.	Although you bring me joy, I can’t take joy in this exchange of promises tonight.
This bud of love, by summer’s ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.	Our love, which right now is like a flower bud in the summer air, may turn out to be a beautiful flower by the next time we meet.
As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast.	I hope you enjoy the same sweet peace and rest I feel in my heart.
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?	Oh, are you going to leave me so unsatisfied?
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?	What satisfaction could you possibly have tonight?
Th' exchange of thy love’s faithful vow for mine.	I pledged my love to you before you asked me to.
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it, And yet I would it were to give again.	Yet I wish I could take that promise back, so I had it to give again.
Wouldst thou withdraw it?	You would take it back?
For what purpose, love?	Why would you do that, my love?
But to be frank, and give it thee again.	Only to be generous and give it to you once more.
And yet I wish but for the thing I have.	But I’m wishing for something I already have.
My bounty is as boundless as the sea, My love as deep.	My generosity to you is as limitless as the sea, and my love is as deep.
I hear some noise within.	I hear a noise inside.
Dear love, adieu.— Anon, good Nurse!—Sweet Montague, be true.	Sweet Montague, be true.
Stay but a little.	Stay here for a moment.
I will come again.	I’ll come back.
O blessèd, blessèd night!	Oh, blessed, blessed night!
I am afeard, Being in night, all this is but a dream, Too flattering sweet to be substantial.	Because it’s dark out, I’m afraid all this is just a dream, too sweet to be real.
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.	Three words, dear Romeo, and then it’s good night for real.
Fear me not.	Don’t worry about me.
Let us take the law of our sides.	I  Let’s not break the law by starting a fight.
Let them begin.	Let them start something.
I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.	I’ll frown at them as they pass by, and they can react however they want.
Nay, as they dare.	You mean however they dare.
I will bite my thumb at them, which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.	I’ll bite my thumb at them.
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?	Hey, are you biting your thumb at us?
I do bite my thumb, sir.	I’m biting my thumb.
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?	Are you biting your thumb at us?
Do you quarrel, sir?	Are you trying to start a fight?
Quarrel, sir?	Start a fight?
No, sir.	No, sir.
Tomorrow will I send.	Tomorrow I’ll send the messenger.
So thrive my soul— A thousand times good night!	My soul depends on it— A thousand times good night.
A thousand times the worse to want thy light.	Leaving you is a thousand times worse than being near you.
Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud, Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies, And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine, With repetition of “My Romeo!” It is my soul that calls upon my name.	Oh, I wish I could make a  My soul is calling out my name.
How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night, Like softest music to attending ears!	The sound of lovers calling each others names through the night is silver-sweet.
Romeo!	Romeo!
My nyas?	My baby hawk?
What o'clock tomorrow Shall I send to thee?	What time tomorrow should I send a messenger to you?
By the hour of nine.	By nine o'clock.
I will not fail.	I won’t fail.
Tis twenty year till then.	From now until then seems like twenty years.
I have forgot why I did call thee back.	I have forgotten why I called you back.
Let me stand here till thou remember it.	Let me stand here until you remember your reason.
And I’ll still stay, to have thee still forget, Forgetting any other home but this.	I’ll forget that I have any home besides this spot right here.
Tis almost morning.	It’s almost morning.
And yet no further than a wanton’s bird, That lets it hop a little from his hand Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves, And with a silken thread plucks it back again, So loving-jealous of his liberty.	He lets the bird hop a little from his hand and then yanks him back by a string.
I would I were thy bird.	I wish I was your bird.
Sweet, so would I.	My sweet, so do I.
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.	But I would kill you by petting you too much.
Good night, good night!	Good night, good night.
Parting is such sweet sorrow That I shall say good night till it be morrow.	Parting is such sweet sorrow that I’ll say good night until tonight becomes tomorrow.
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast.	I hope you sleep peacefully.
Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest.	I wish I were Sleep and Peace, so I could spend the night with you.
Hence will I to my ghostly friar’s close cell, His help to crave and my dear hap to tell.	Now I’ll go see my priest, to ask for his help and tell him about my good luck.
The gray-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night, Checkering the eastern clouds with streaks of light, And fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels From forth day’s path and Titan’s fiery wheels.	Darkness is stumbling out of the sun’s path like a drunk man.
Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye, The day to cheer and night’s dank dew to dry, I must upfill this osier cage of ours With baleful weeds and precious-juicèd flowers.	Now, before the sun comes up and burns away the dew, I have to fill this basket of mine with poisonous weeds and medicinal flowers.
The earth, that’s nature’s mother, is her tomb.	The Earth is nature’s mother and also nature’s tomb.
And from her womb children of divers kind We sucking on her natural bosom find, Many for many virtues excellent, None but for some and yet all different.	From the Earth’s womb, many different sorts of plants and animals come forth, and the Earth provides her children with many excellent forms of nourishment.
Oh, mickle is the powerful grace that lies In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities.	Herbs, plants, and stones possess great power.
For naught so vile that on the earth doth live But to the earth some special good doth give.	There is nothing on Earth that is so evil that it does not provide the earth with some special quality.
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied, And vice sometime by action dignified.	Virtue turns to vice if it’s misused.
Within the infant rind of this small flower Poison hath residence and medicine power.	Inside the little rind of this weak flower, there is both poison and powerful medicine.
Two such opposèd kings encamp them still, In man as well as herbs—grace and rude will.	There are two opposite elements in everything, in men as well as in herbs—good and evil.
And where the worser is predominant, Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.	When evil is dominant, death soon kills the body like cancer.
Good morrow, Father.	Good morning, father.
Benedicite.	God bless you.
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?	Who greets me so early in the morning?
Young son, it argues a distempered head So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.	Young man, something’s wrong if you’re getting out of bed this early.
Care keeps his watch in every old man’s eye, And where care lodges, sleep will never lie.	Every old man has worries, and worried men never get any sleep, but young men shouldn’t have a care in the world.
But where unbruisèd youth with unstuffed brain Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.	They should get to bed early and get plenty of sleep.
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure Thou art uproused by some distemperature.	Therefore, the fact that you’re awake this early tells me you’ve been upset with some anxiety.
Or if not so, then here I hit it right: Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight.	If that’s not the case, then this must be the answer: You, Romeo, have not been to bed tonight.
That last is true.	Your last guess is right.
The sweeter rest was mine.	I enjoyed a sweeter rest than sleep.
With Rosaline, my ghostly Father?	With Rosaline, father?
That’s my good son.	That’s good, my boy.
But where hast thou been, then?	But where have you been?
I’ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.	I’ll tell you before you have to ask me again.
Both our remedies Within thy help and holy physic lies.	You have the sacred power to cure both of us.
I bear no hatred, blessèd man, for, lo, My intercession likewise steads my foe.	I carry no hatred, holy man, because my request will benefit my enemy.
Here comes your father.	Here comes your father.
Never make denial.	Don’t even think about refusing.
I must and will have Katherine to my wife.	I must and will have Katherine for my wife.
Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter?	Now, Signior Petruchio, how are you getting on with my daughter?
How but well, sir?	Beautifully, sir, beautifully!
Why, how now, daughter Katherine?	Now, daughter Katherine?
In your dumps?	Are you down in the dumps?
Call you me daughter?	You have the nerve to call me daughter?
Father, ’tis thus: yourself and all the world That talked of her have talked amiss of her.	Sir, this is the truth: you and the rest—all the people who have ever talked about her—have all been wrong.
I’ll see thee hanged on Sunday first.	She has the patience of a  I’ll see you hanged on Sunday first!
Hark, Petruchio: she says she’ll see thee hanged first.	Listen to that Petruchio: she says she’ll see you hanged first.
Is this your speeding?	Is this your idea of success?
Nay, then, good night our part.	So much for our plan.
Be patient, gentlemen.	Relax, gentlemen.
I choose her for myself.	I’ve made my choice.
If she and I be pleased, what’s that to you?	If she and I are happy, what’s it to you?
Tis bargained ’twixt us twain, being alone, That she shall still be curst in company.	When we were alone, we agreed that in public she would go on being unpleasant.
I tell you, ’tis incredible to believe How much she loves me.	I tell you, though, it’s incredible how much she loves me.
O, the kindest Kate!	Darling Kate!
O, you are novices!	You men are rank beginners!
Tis a world to see, How tame, when men and women are alone, A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.— Give me thy hand, Kate.	Give me your hand, Kate.
I will unto Venice To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding day.	I’m off to Venice to buy outfits for the wedding.
God send you joy, Petruchio.	God give you joy, Petruchio.
Tis a match.	Call it a match!
Amen, say we.	Amen to that!
We will be witnesses.	We’ll be your witnesses.
Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu.	Father, wife, friends—farewell!
I will to Venice.	I’m off to Venice.
Sunday comes apace.	Sunday is just around the corner.
We will be married o' Sunday.	We’re to be married on Sunday.
Was ever match clapped up so suddenly?	Was there ever a match put together so quickly?
Twill bring you gain or perish on the seas.	I’ve made a risky investment.
The gain I seek is quiet in the match.	The only profit I seek is a peaceful match.
No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.	There’s no doubt that Petruchio’s got quite a catch.
But now, Baptista, to your younger daughter.	Now, Baptista, let’s turn to your younger daughter.
Now is the day we long have lookèd for.	We’ve been waiting a long time for this day.
I am your neighbor, and was suitor first.	I’m your neighbor and came courting first.
Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.   Graybeard, thy love doth freeze.	Callow youth, you don’t yet know how to love!
But thine doth fry.	And you’re all sizzle.
Skipper, stand back.	Stand back, boy.
Tis age that nourisheth.	Age is the thing that nourishes.
Content you, gentlemen.	Enough, gentlemen.
I will compound this strife.	I will settle this matter.
First, as you know, my house within the city Is richly furnishèd with plate and gold, Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands; My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry, In ivory coffers I have stuffed my crowns, In cypress chests my arras counterpoints, Costly apparel, tents, and canopies, Fine linen, Turkey cushions bossed with pearl, Valance of Venice gold in needlework, Pewter and brass, and all things that belong To house or housekeeping.	First of all, my house in the city, as you know, is filled with expensive furniture and household articles, china and gold, basins and pitchers for her to wash her dainty hands in.
Then, at my farm I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail, Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls, And all things answerable to this portion.	Then, at my farm I have a hundred milk cows, a hundred and twenty fat oxen in my stables, and all the equipment necessary to maintain them.
Two thousand ducats by the year of land!	Two thousand ducats a year from his land!
Nay, I have offered all, I have no more, And she can have no more than all I have.	I can’t offer her more than all I have.
I must confess your offer is the best, And, let your father make her the assurance, She is your own; else, you must pardon me.	I must admit your offer is the best.
If you should die before him, where’s her dower?	Otherwise—forgive me, but if you should die before him, what becomes of her dowry?
And may not young men die as well as old?	Oh, and young men never die?
Well, gentlemen, I am thus resolved: On Sunday next, you know My daughter Katherina is to be married.	As you know, next Sunday my daughter Katherina is to be married.
I think ’twas Soto that your Honor means.	I believe your Honor is thinking of a character called Soto.
Tis very true.	Yes, that was it.
Thou didst it excellent.	You gave an excellent performance.
There is a lord will hear you play tonight; But I am doubtful of your modesties, Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior— For yet his Honor never heard a play— You break into some merry passion And so offend him.	There is a particular lord who will watch you perform tonight.
Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery And give them friendly welcome every one.	Go, lad, and take them to the pantry.
Adieu, good neighbor.	Farewell, good neighbor.
Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool To give thee all and in his waning age Set foot under thy table.	Your father would be a fool to give you all his wealth and spend his declining years as a guest in your house.
Tut, a toy!	It’s absurd.
An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.	An old Italian fox is never that generous, my boy.
A vengeance on your crafty withered hide!	Sneaky, dried-up old coot!
Fathers commonly Do get their children.	Usually fathers produce children, not the other way around.
But in this case of wooing, A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.	But in this case of wooing, a child shall father his own father—if my wits don’t fail me.
His lecture will be done ere you have tuned.	I’ll have my lessons in the order and manner
Where left we last?	Where did we leave off?
Here, madam:     Conster them.	Here, madam:     Translate.
Now let me see if I can conster it.	Now let me see if I can translate it.
I must believe my master; else, I promise you, I should be arguing still upon that doubt.	There’s no need to be, really, for—  You’re my teacher, so I must believe you.
But let it rest.—Now, Litio, to you.	But let it go.—Now, Litio, it’s your turn.
Good master, take it not unkindly, pray, That I have been thus pleasant with you both.	I hope, sir, that you’re not angry that I’ve been equally attentive to you both!
Call you this “gamut”?	You call this a scale?
Tut, I like it not.	I don’t like it.
Old fashions please me best.	I like doing things the old-fashioned way.
Mistress, your father prays you leave your books And help to dress your sister’s chamber up.	Mistress, your father requests that you leave your books and come help decorate your sister’s room.
You know tomorrow is the wedding day.	You know tomorrow is her wedding day.
Farewell, sweet masters both.	Farewell to both of you, dear teachers.
I must be gone.	I have to go.
But I have cause to pry into this pedant.	But there’s reason for me to look more closely at this schoolmaster.
Methinks he looks as though he were in love.	He acts like a man in love.
No shame but mine.	The humiliation is all mine.
Now must the world point at poor Katherine And say, “Lo, there is mad Petruchio’s wife, If it would please him come and marry her!”   Upon my life, Petruchio means but well, Whatever fortune stays him from his word: Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise; Though he be merry, yet withal he’s honest.	So now everyone will point at me and say, “Look, there goes the wife of that comedian Petruchio—if he could be bothered to marry the pathetic thing!”
Would Katherine had never seen him, though!	Maybe, but I wish I’d never laid eyes on him.
Go, girl.	Go, daughter.
I cannot blame thee now to weep, For such an injury would vex a very saint, Much more a shrew of thy impatient humor.	I cannot blame you now for weeping.
Master, master!	Master, master!
News, old news, and such news as you never heard of!	I have news—old news such as you never heard before!
Is it new and old too?	You say you have news that’s old?
How may that be?	How can that be?
Why, is it not news to hear of Petruchio’s coming?	Well, is it not news that Petruchio’s coming?
Is he come?	Is he here?
Why, no, sir.	Why, no, sir.
What then?	What then?
He is coming.	He is coming.
When will he be here?	When will he be here?
When he stands where I am and sees you there.	When he stands where I am and sees you there.
Who comes with him?	Who comes with him?
A monster, a very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian footboy or a gentleman’s lackey.	He’s dressed like a freak, a total freak, and not at all like a proper footman or a gentleman’s valet.
I am glad he’s come, howsoe'er he comes.	I am glad he’s coming, however he’s dressed.
Why, sir, he comes not.	Why, sir, he’s not coming.
Didst thou not say he comes?	Didn’t you just say he was?
Who?	Who?
That Petruchio came?	Petruchio?
Ay, that Petruchio came.	Yes, Petruchio.
No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his back.	No, I said his horse is coming, with him on its back.
Why, that’s all one.	Well, that’s the same thing.
Nay, by Saint Jamy, I hold you a penny, A horse and a man Is more than one And yet not many.	No, by Saint Jamy, I’ll bet you a penny!
You are welcome, sir.	You are welcome, sir.
See this dispatched with all the haste thou canst: Anon I’ll give thee more instructions.	I’ll give you more instructions later.
I know the boy will well usurp the grace, Voice, gait, and action of a gentlewoman.	I know the boy will be a convincing gentlewoman, taking up her exact walk and talk and gentle gestures.
I long to hear him call the drunkard “husband,” And how my men will stay themselves from laughter When they do homage to this simple peasant.	I can’t wait to hear him call the drunkard “husband,” and to watch my men smother their laughter as they pay their respects to this simple peasant.
I’ll in to counsel them.	I’ll go and coach them.
Where is my love?	Where is my lovely bride?
Why, sir, you know this is your wedding day.	Why, sir, you know this is your wedding day.
Tedious it were to tell and harsh to hear.	It’s a long story—and tough to listen to.
But where is Kate?	But where is Kate?
I stay too long from her.	We’re wasting time here.
See not your bride in these unreverent robes.	Don’t greet your bride in these disgraceful clothes.
Go to my chamber, put on clothes of mine.	Go to my room and put on something of mine.
Not I, believe me.	Not me.
Thus I’ll visit her.	I’ll see her like this.
But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.	But surely you’re not planning to
Good sooth, even thus.	Yes, just like this.
Could I repair what she will wear in me As I can change these poor accoutrements, 'Twere well for Kate and better for myself.	Though I expect she’ll wear me out more quickly than I’ll wear out what I’m wearing—which will be good for her and even better for me!
But what a fool am I to chat with you, When I should bid good morrow to my bride And seal the title with a lovely kiss!	But what a fool I am to stand here chatting when I should bid good morning to my bride and seal the bargain with a loving kiss.
He hath some meaning in his mad attire.	He must be wearing this crazy outfit for some reason.
We will persuade him, be it possible, To put on better ere he go to church.	I’ll try to persuade him to put on something more appropriate before going to the church, if it’s at all possible.
I’ll after him, and see the event of this.	I’ll go too and make sure that happens.
So shall you quietly enjoy your hope And marry sweet Bianca with consent.	And
We’ll overreach the graybeard, Gremio, The narrow-prying father, Minola, The quaint musician, amorous Litio, All for my master’s sake, Lucentio.	We’ll outwit them all—that old geezer, Gremio; the suspicious father, Minola; the prim musician lover, Litio—all for the sake of my master, Lucentio.
Signior Gremio, came you from the church?	Signior Gremio, are you coming from the church?
As willingly as e'er I came from school.	As eagerly as I ever came from school.
A bridegroom, say you?	Bridegroom?
Why, he’s a devil, a devil, a very fiend.	No, he’s a devil—a devil, I tell you!
Tut, she’s a lamb, a dove, a fool to him!	Why, she’s a lamb, a dove, a child compared to him!
Now take them up,” quoth he, “if any list.”   Trembled and shook, for why he stamped and swore As if the vicar meant to cozen him.	She trembled and shook because he stamped and swore and carried on as though the vicar were trying to put something over on him.
But after many ceremonies done, He calls for wine.	Finally, the ceremony done, he called for wine.
This done, he took the bride about the neck And kissed her lips with such a clamorous smack That at the parting all the church did echo.	Next he slung his arm around the bride’s neck and kissed her with such a smack that when they parted the sound of their lips made the whole church echo.
Such a mad marriage never was before.	That was the limit for me.
Hark, hark!	It’s disgraceful!
I hear the minstrels play.	There go the minstrels.
Is ’t possible you will away tonight?	You’re not thinking of leaving tonight, surely?
Make it no wonder.	Not tonight—today.
If you knew my business, You would entreat me rather go than stay.	If you knew the reason, you’d understand and would urge me to go rather than stay.
And, honest company, I thank you all, That have beheld me give away myself To this most patient, sweet and virtuous wife.	Good friends, I thank you all for coming to see me wed this patient, sweet, virtuous wife.
Let me entreat you.	Goodbye to you all.
It cannot be.	Can’t do it.
Let me entreat you.	As a favor to  Nope.
I am content.	As a favor to  I’m delighted.
Are you content to stay?	Delighted to stay?
I am content you shall entreat me stay, But yet not stay, entreat me how you can.	Delighted to hear you ask so nicely, but I won’t stay in any case.
Now, if you love me, stay.	Look, if you love me, stay.
Grumio, my horse.	Grumio, get me my horse.
Ay, sir, they be ready.	Yes, sir, they’re ready.
The oats have eaten the horses.	They’ve eaten themselves sick.
The door is open, sir.	The door is open, sir.
There lies your way.	Go on, wear your boots out!
For me, I’ll not be gone till I please myself.	As for me, I’ll leave when I like.
O Kate, content thee.	Calm down, Kate.
Prithee, be not angry.	Please don’t be angry.
I will be angry.	I will be angry.
What hast thou to do?— Father, be quiet.	What business is it of yours?—Father, be quiet.
He shall stay my leisure.	He’ll stay as long as I say.
Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.	Okay, now it starts!
Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner.	Gentlemen, on to the bridal dinner.
I see a woman may be made a fool If she had not a spirit to resist.	I see a woman may be made a fool of if she doesn’t have nerve enough to stand up for herself.
I’ll buckler thee against a million.	They
Nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones.	No, let them go.
Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing.	They’re certainly a peaceful couple!
That, being mad herself, she’s madly mated.	That since she’s mad herself, she’s married a madman.
Neighbors and friends, though bride and bridegroom wants For to supply the places at the table, You know there wants no junkets at the feast.	Neighbors and friends, though we don’t have anyone for the bride and bridegroom’s places at the table, you know there’s nothing missing in the feast itself.
She shall, Lucentio.	She shall, Lucentio.
Come, gentlemen, let’s go.	Come, gentlemen, let’s go in.
Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and all foul ways!	To hell with all worn-out horses, all crazy masters, and all bad roads.
Was ever man so beaten?	Was a man ever beaten as much as me?
Was ever man so 'rayed?	Was a man ever as dirty as me?
Was ever man so weary?	Was a man ever so tired?
I am sent before to make a fire, and they are coming after to warm them.	I have been sent on ahead to light a fire, and they are coming after to warm themselves.
Now, were not I a little pot and soon hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my belly, ere I should come by a fire to thaw me.	It’s a good thing I’m like a little pot and warm up quickly, or else my lips themselves would freeze and stick to my teeth, my tongue to the roof of my mouth, and my heart would freeze in my belly, before I managed to get thawed out.
But I with blowing the fire shall warm myself.	I’ll warm myself by blowing on the fire.
Who is that calls so coldly?	Who calls so coldly?
A piece of ice.	A piece of ice.
If thou doubt it, thou mayst slide from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run but my head and my neck.	Trust me, you could slide all the way from my shoulder to my heel taking no more of a running start than the distance between my head and my neck.
A fire, good Curtis.	Start the fire, good Curtis.
Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?	Are my master and his wife coming, Grumio?
Oh, ay, Curtis, ay, and therefore fire, fire.	Yes, yes, Curtis, so hurry up and start the fire.
Cast on no water.	Leave out the water.
Is she so hot a shrew as she’s reported?	Is she as fiery a shrew as they say?
She was, good Curtis, before this frost.	Well she was, good Curtis, before this frost.
Why, thy horn is a foot, and so long am I, at the least.	Your horn is a foot long, and I’m at least that size.
I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world?	So tell me, Grumio, how goes the world?
Do thy duty, and have thy duty, for my master and mistress are almost frozen to death.	Therefore, do your duty and take your reward, because my master and mistress are nearly frozen to death.
There’s fire ready.	The fire is ready.
And therefore, good Grumio, the news.	So go on, tell me the news.
Why, therefore fire, for I have caught extreme cold.	I think I’m getting delirious.
Where’s the cook?	Where’s the cook?
Is supper ready, the house trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwebs swept, the servingmen in their new fustian, their white stockings, and every officer his wedding garment on?	Is supper ready?
Be the Jacks fair within, the Jills fair without, the carpets laid, and everything in order?	Are all the cups and glasses in their places, the tablecloths laid out—everything in order?
For God’s sake, a pot of small ale.	For God’s sake, would someone bring me a mug of beer!
Will ’t please your Honor taste of these conserves?	Would your Honor like to try this dried fruit?

All ready.	Everything’s ready.
And therefore, I pray thee, news.	So tell me what’s been going on.
First, know my horse is tired, my master and mistress fallen out.	Well, first of all, my horse is tired and my master and mistress have had a falling out.
How?	How?
Out of their saddles into the dirt, and thereby hangs a tale.	From their saddles into the dirt—but that’s another story.
Let’s ha' ’t, good Grumio.	Well, let’s have it, Grumio.
Lend thine ear.	Lean forward.
Here.	Here.
There!	There!
This ’tis to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.	This is to feel the news, not hear it.
And therefore ’tis called a sensible tale.	That’s what makes it “sensitive” news.
And this cuff was but to knock at your ear and beseech list'ning.	I was just knocking to see if anyone was home.
Now I begin: Imprimis, we came down a foul hill, my master riding behind my mistress— Both of one horse?	Now, I’ll begin: first, we came down a steep hill, my master riding behind my mistress— Both on one horse?
What’s that to thee?	What’s the difference?
Why, a horse.	Well, the difference of a horse!
Tell thou the tale!	It’s too bad.
Ay, and that thou and the proudest of you all shall find when he comes home.	Yes—as you and the rest will find out as soon as he’s home.
But what talk I of this?	But why am I telling you this?
Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip, Walter, Sugarsop, and the rest.	Get them in here—Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip, Walter, Sugarsop, and the rest.
Let their heads be slickly combed, their blue coats brushed, and their garters of an indifferent knit.	Tell them to slick down their hair, brush their blue coats, and make sure their socks match.
Let them curtsy with their left legs, and not presume to touch a hair of my master’s horse-tail till they kiss their hands.	Have them click their heels together and don’t dare touch a hair of the master’s horse’s tail till they kiss their hands.
Are they all ready?	Are they all ready?
They are.	They are.

Who knows not that?	Yeah, so?
Thou, it seems, that calls for company to countenance her.	You just said they had to face her.
I call them forth to credit her.	I meant they had to give her credit.

Where is the foolish knave I sent before?	Where is the fool I sent on ahead?
Here, sir, as foolish as I was before.	Here, sir, as foolish as ever.
You peasant swain!	You unwashed farmworker!
You whoreson malt-horse drudge!	You bastard workhorse drudge!
Did I not bid thee meet me in the park And bring along these rascal knaves with thee?	Didn’t I tell you to meet me outside and bring these morons with you?
Nathaniel’s coat, sir, was not fully made, And Gabriel’s pumps were all unpinked i' th' heel.	Nathaniel’s coat was being fixed, sir.
There was no link to color Peter’s hat, And Walter’s dagger was not come from sheathing.	And Walter couldn’t get his dagger out of its sheath.
There were none fine but Adam, Rafe, and Gregory.	Only Adam, Rafe, and Gregory were ready.
Go, rascals, go, and fetch my supper in.	Go, blockheads, go, and bring my supper to me.
One, Kate, that you must kiss and be acquainted with.— Where are my slippers?	Where are my slippers?
Shall I have some water?— Come, Kate, and wash, and welcome heartily.— You whoreson villain!	Can we have some water please here?— Come and wash, Kate, make yourself at home.
Will you let it fall?	Take it easy!
Patience, I pray you!	Please!
Twas a fault unwilling.	It was just an accident!
Will you give thanks, sweet Kate, or else shall I?— What’s this?	Will you say grace, sweet Kate, or shall I?—What is this?
Mutton?	Mutton?
Ay.	Yes.
Who brought it?	Who brought it out here?
I.	I did.
What dogs are these!	You bastards!
Where is the rascal cook?	Where is that moron of a cook?
How durst you, villains, bring it from the dresser And serve it thus to me that love it not?	How dare you serve it to me this way!
There, take it to you, trenchers, cups, and all!	There, take it all back—plates, cups, the whole thing.
I pray you, husband, be not so disquiet.	Please, dear, calm down.
The meat was well, if you were so contented.	The meat was fine if you wanted to eat it.
I tell thee, Kate, ’twas burnt and dried away.	And I’m telling you it was burnt and dried out.
Come, I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber.	Come, I’ll show you your bridal chamber.
Peter, didst ever see the like?	Peter, did you ever see anything like it?
He kills her in her own humor.	He’s giving her a taste of her own medicine.
Where is he?	Where is he?
Away, away, for he is coming hither!	Look out, he’s coming!
Thus have I politicly begun my reign, And ’tis my hope to end successfully.	Well, I’ve begun my reign with a carefully thought-out plan, and I have every hope of succeeding.
My falcon now is sharp and passing empty, And, till she stoop, she must not be full-gorged, For then she never looks upon her lure.	My falcon is now hungry and unfed and must not be given enough to eat until she comes to me, for if her hunger is satisfied, she’ll pay no attention to the bait.
Another way I have to man my haggard, To make her come and know her keeper’s call.	I have another plan to make my bird come to me and recognize her owner’s call is to keep her from sleeping—
That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites That bate and beat and will not be obedient.	the way trainers do with young hawks that flutter and flap and will not obey.
She ate no meat today, nor none shall eat.	She had no food today and will have none.
Last night she slept not, nor tonight she shall not.	Last night she got no sleep, and she won’t get any tonight.
As with the meat, some undeservèd fault I’ll find about the making of the bed, And here I’ll fling the pillow, there the bolster, This way the coverlet, another way the sheets.	Just as I did with the meat, I’ll make up some problem with the way the bed is made, and throw the pillow one way and the cushion the other, and the blanket over here and the sheets over there.
And, in conclusion, she shall watch all night, And if she chance to nod I’ll rail and brawl, And with the clamor keep her still awake.	And if she starts to drop off, I’ll rant and yell until I wake her up.
He that knows better how to tame a shrew, Now let him speak; ’tis charity to show.	If anyone here knows a better way to tame a shrew, speak up, please.
Is ’t possible, friend Litio, that mistress Bianca Doth fancy any other but Lucentio?	It would be much appreciated.
What, master, read you?	What are you reading, teacher?
First resolve me that.	Answer me that first.
And may you prove, sir, master of your art.	I hope you’re an expert in your field.
I tell thee, Litio, this is wonderful!	Let me come clean.
Mistake no more.	I’m not really Litio.
Know, sir, that I am called Hortensio.	My name is Hortensio, sir.
See how they kiss and court!	Look how they kiss and carry on!
Fie on her!	The hell with her!
See how beastly she doth court him!	Look how she carries on with him!
Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!	It’s revolting!
For me, that I may surely keep mine oath, I will be married to a wealthy widow, Ere three days pass, which hath as long loved me As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard.	Well, to be on the safe side—so I don’t go back on my promise—I plan to get myself married to a wealthy widow within the next three days.
And so farewell, Signior Lucentio.	Farewell, then, Signior Lucentio.
Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks, Shall win my love, and so I take my leave, In resolution as I swore before.	From now on, goodness in women, not superficial beauty, will win my heart.

Am not I Christopher Sly, old Sly’s son of Burton Heath, by birth a peddler, by education a cardmaker, by transmutation a bearherd, and now by present profession a tinker?	I’m Christopher Sly, son of old Sly of Barton-on-Heath, a peddler by birth, a  Oh, this is why your poor wife is mourning!
Oh, this is it that makes your servants droop!	And this is why your servants hang their heads in sorrow!
O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth, Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment, And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.	Oh noble lord, consider your lineage.
Look how thy servants do attend on thee, Each in his office ready at thy beck.	Look how your servants wait on you, each one ready to do whatever you command.
Wilt thou have music?	Would you care to hear some music?
Hark!	Listen!
Apollo plays, And twenty cagèd nightingales do sing: Or wilt thou sleep?	Do you want to sleep?
We’ll have thee to a couch Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed On purpose trimmed up for Semiramis.	We’ll have a couch made up that’s softer and more fragrant even than the bed of lustful
Or wilt thou hunt?	You’re busted.
Nay, I have ta'en you napping, gentle love, And have forsworn you with Hortensio.	Hortensio and I have given you up.
Tranio, you jest.	You can’t mean it, Tranio!
But have you both forsworn me?	Have you both really given me up?
Mistress, we have.	Yes, ma'am, we have.
Then we are rid of Litio.	So Litio’s out of the picture.
I' faith, he’ll have a lusty widow now That shall be wooed and wedded in a day.	He’s going after a young widow.
God give him joy!	Well, good for him!
Ay, and he’ll tame her.	Yeah, and he’s going to tame her.
He says so, Tranio?	Is that what he says?
The taming school?	The taming school?
What, is there such a place?	Is there such a place?
Ay, mistress, and Petruchio is the master, That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.	Master, master, I’ve been on the lookout so long, I’m ready to fall down dead—but I’ve got one, finally!
What is he, Biondello?	What does he look like, Biondello?
And what of him, Tranio?	And what about him, Tranio?
Take in your love, and then let me alone.	Go, take your sweetheart and leave him to me.
God save you, sir.	May God keep you well, sir.
You are welcome.	This is it, for now.
Of Mantua.	Mantua.
My life, sir!	Killed?
how, I pray?	Why?
For that goes hard.	That would be a little extreme!
Tis death for anyone in Mantua To come to Padua.	It’s a capital offense for anyone from Mantua to come to Padua.
Know you not the cause?	Didn’t you know?
Tis marvel, but that you are but newly come, You might have heard it else proclaimed about.	It’s strange that you haven’t heard.
Alas, sir, it is worse for me than so, For I have bills for money by exchange From Florence, and must here deliver them.	I have promissory notes from Florence that I have to deliver.
Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been, Pisa renownèd for grave citizens.	Oh yes, sir, I have often been to Pisa—Pisa, City of Wise Men.

The more my wrong, the more his spite appears.	The more I suffer, the more spiteful he becomes.
What, did he marry me to famish me?	Did he marry me just to starve me?
If not, elsewhere they meet with charity.	And if they don’t find charity there, they find it someplace else.
But I, who never knew how to entreat, Nor never needed that I should entreat, Am starved for meat, giddy for lack of sleep, With oaths kept waking and with brawling fed.	But I, who have never known how to beg and never had to beg, am starved for food, dizzy with lack of sleep, kept awake with curses and fed with brawling.
And that which spites me more than all these wants, He does it under name of perfect love, As who should say, if I should sleep or eat, 'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.	And what irks me more than all these things put together is that he does it under the pretense of love—as though for me to eat or sleep would bring on fatal illness or sudden death.
What say you to a neat’s foot?	What do you say to a calf’s foot?
Tis passing good.	Oh, lovely.
I prithee let me have it.	Can I have some?

Why then, the mustard without the beef.	How about the mustard without the beef.
Go, get thee gone, I say.	Get out of here, you measly, lying wretch.

Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak, And speak I will.	Sir, I think I have the right to speak, and speak I certainly will.
I am no child, no babe.	I am not a child or an infant.
Your betters have endured me say my mind, And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.	Better men than you have heard me speak my mind, and if you can’t take it, then you’d better plug your ears.
Why, thou say’st true.	You know, you’re right.
It is a paltry cap, A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie.	It’s a measly little cap, a dessert crust, a plaything, a silk pie.
I love thee well in that thou lik’st it not.	I love you all the more for not liking it.

Tis like a demi-cannon.	It’s like a cannon.
What, up and down, carved like an apple tart?	Carved it up and down like an apple tart?
Here’s snip and nip and cut and slish and slash, Like to a censer in a barber’s shop.	Snip and snip and cut and slash—it’s got more holes than a sieve!
Why, what i' devil’s name, tailor, call’st thou this?	What in the world do you call this, tailor!
You bid me make it orderly and well, According to the fashion and the time.	You told me to make it well and properly and in keeping with the current style.
Marry, and did.	Certainly, I did.
But if you be remembered, I did not bid you mar it to the time.	But if you remember, I didn’t tell you to parody the style.
I’ll none of it.	I won’t take it.
Hence, make your best of it.	Do whatever you want with it.
I never saw a better-fashioned gown, More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable.	I never saw a better-designed gown, more elegant and pleasing and well made.

Thou hast braved many men; brave not me.	You have bested many things, well don’t try and best me.
I will neither be faced nor braved.	I will not be faced or bested.
I say unto thee, I bid thy master cutout the gown, but I did not bid him cut it to pieces.	I tell you I requested that your master cut out the gown, but I didn’t ask him to cut it all to pieces.
Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify.	Why, here is the order to prove it.
Read it.	Read it.
The note lies in ’s throat, if he say I said so.	The note is a big fat liar if it says I said so.
Dost thou love pictures?	Do you like pictures?
Thou hast a lady far more beautiful Than any woman in this waning age.	You have a noble wife who is much more beautiful than any other woman in this declining age.
And till the tears that she hath shed for thee Like envious floods o'errun her lovely face, She was the fairest creature in the world— And yet she is inferior to none.	Before she began shedding tears all over her lovely face, she was the fairest creature in the world—and even now she has no equal.

Villain, not for thy life!	Certainly not!
Take up my mistress' gown for thy master’s use!	Take off my mistress' gown for your master’s use!
Why, sir, what’s your conceit in that?	Why, what’s the problem?
O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think for.	Oh, sir, the problem goes far deeper than you realize.
Take up my mistress' gown to his master’s use!	Take up my mistress' gown for his master’s use!

My father’s bears more toward the marketplace.	My father-in-law lives closer to the marketplace.

I dare swear this is the right Vincentio.	I could swear this is the real Vincentio.
Nay, I dare not swear it.	Well, no, not literally.
Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio.	No, I know that you’re Signior Lucentio.
Away with the dotard!	Away with the doddering fool!
To the jail with him!	Take him off to jail!
O!	We’re ruined!
We are spoiled and yonder he is!	There he is!
Pardon, sweet father.	Pardon, dear father.
Lives my sweet son?	Dear son, you’re alive!
Pardon, dear father.	Pardon us, dear father.
How hast thou offended?	What have you done?
Where is Lucentio?	Where is Lucentio?

Where is that damnèd villain, Tranio, That faced and braved me in this matter so?	Where is that damned wretch, Tranio, who defied me in such a disgraceful manner?
Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?	Say, isn’t this the Latin master Cambio?
Cambio is changed into Lucentio.	Cambio is transformed into Lucentio.
Love wrought these miracles.	It was love that performed these miracles.
Bianca’s love Made me exchange my state with Tranio, While he did bear my countenance in the town, And happily I have arrivèd at the last Unto the wishèd haven of my bliss.	Bianca’s love made me trade places with Tranio while he masqueraded as me around town.
What Tranio did, myself enforced him to.	What Tranio did, he did at my command.
Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.	So pardon him, dear father, for my sake.

No, sir, God forbid, but ashamed to kiss.	But I’m ashamed to kiss, sir.

Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.	Hortensio
You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense: I mean, Hortensio is afeard of you.	That’s very sensible, but you missed my sense: I meant Hortensio is afraid of you.

Roundly replied.	A very candid reply.
Mistress, how mean you that?	What’s that supposed to mean?
Thus I conceive by him.	That’s what I conceive of him.
Very well mended.	Nice save!
Kiss him for that, good widow.	Kiss him for that, good widow.

And now you know my meaning.	And now you know my meaning.
A very mean meaning.	A very nasty meaning.
Right, I mean you.	My meaning  And I

A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.	I’ll bet you a hundred marks, my Kate puts her flat on her back.
That’s my office.	Well, that’s really my job.
Spoke like an officer!	Well said!
Ha' to thee, lad!	Here’s to you!
How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?	What do you think of these quick-witted folks, Gremio?
Believe me, sir, they butt together well.	They certainly do like to butt heads!
Ay, but not frighted me.	Yes, but not out of fear.
Therefore I’ll sleep again.	I’ll go back to sleep now.
Nay, that you shall not.	No, you shall not.
Am I your bird?	I’ll
She hath prevented me.	Well, she got away.
Here, Signior Tranio, This bird you aimed at, though you hit her not.— Therefore a health to all that shot and missed.	Signior Tranio, you also took aim at that bird, though you didn’t hit her.—So here’s a health to all who’ve shot and missed.
A good swift simile, but something currish.	A witty if a cynical reply.
Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself.	It’s good you hunted for yourself, sir.
Tranio hits you now.	Tranio got you that time.
I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.	I thank you for that quip, good Tranio.
He has a little galled me, I confess.	He’s made me a little sore, I’ll admit.
And, as the jest did glance away from me, 'Tis ten to one it maimed you two outright.	But since the gibe glanced off me, ten to one it hit you both straight on.
Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio, I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.	Seriously, though, son Petruchio, I think you have the most thoroughgoing shrew of us all.
Well, I say no.	Well, I disagree.
Content.	Agreed.
What’s the wager?	What’s the bet?
Twenty crowns.	Twenty crowns.
Twenty crowns?	Twenty crowns?
I’ll venture so much of my hawk or hound, But twenty times so much upon my wife.	I’d wager twenty times as much on my wife.
A hundred then.	A hundred then.
Content.	Agreed.
A match!	Good!
Tis done.	It’s a bet.
Who shall begin?	Who should begin?
That will I.	I will.
Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me.	Biondello, go and tell your mistress to come to me.
I go.	Here I go.
Son, I’ll be your half Bianca comes.	Son, I’ll stake you half that Bianca comes.
I’ll have no halves.	I’ll have no halves.
How!	What!
She’s busy, and she cannot come!” Is that an answer?	She’s busy and cannot come!” Is that an answer?
Ay, and a kind one too.	Yes, and a nice one at that.
Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse.	Pray God your wife doesn’t send you a worse one.
I hope better.	I’m hoping for better.
Now, where’s my wife?	So, where’s my wife?
She says you have some goodly jest in hand.	She says she thinks this is a prank.
She will not come.	She will not come.
She bids you come to her.	She says that you should come to her.
Worse and worse.	Worse and worse!
I know her answer.	She  I can guess her answer.
What?	What?

What is your will, sir, that you send for me?	You sent for me, sir?
Where is your sister, and Hortensio’s wife?	Where are your sister and Hortensio’s wife?
They sit conferring by the parlor fire.	They sit chatting by the parlor fire.
Go fetch them hither.	Go bring them here.
If they deny to come, Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands.	If they refuse to come, get physical—use a whip if you have to, but get them out here to their husbands.
Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.	This is a miracle, if you talk of miracles.
And so it is.	It is.
I wonder what it bodes.	I wonder what it means.
Marry, peace it bodes, and love, and quiet life, And awful rule, and right supremacy, And, to be short, what not that’s sweet and happy?	It means peace and love and a quiet life, supremacy based on reverence and profound respect, and—not to go on and on about it—everything that’s sweet and happy.
Now, fair befall thee, good Petruchio!	May good fortune come to you, good Petruchio!
The wager thou hast won, and I will add Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns, Another dowry to another daughter, For she is changed as she had never been.	You’ve won the wager, and I will add twenty thousand crowns to what they owe you.
See where she comes and brings your froward wives As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.— Katherine, that cap of yours becomes you not.	Look, here she comes, with your ungovernable wives in tow, like prisoners of her womanly persuasion.—Katherine, that cap of yours doesn’t look good on you.
Off with that bauble, throw it underfoot.	Take it off and throw it on the ground.
Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh, Till I be brought to such a silly pass!	Lord, may I never see a day of trouble until the day I let someone treat me like that.
Fie!	For shame!
What a foolish duty call you this?	What kind of loyalty is this?
I would your duty were as foolish too.	I wish your loyalty were as foolish.
The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca, Hath cost me an hundred crowns since suppertime.	The wisdom of your loyalty, fair Bianca, has cost me a hundred crowns since dinner.
The more fool you for laying on my duty.	The more fool you for betting on my loyalty.
We will have no telling.	There will be no lecture.
She shall not.	She shall not.
I say she shall.—And first begin with her.	I say she shall.—And first begin with her.
Fie, fie!	Girls, girls!
Unknit that threat'ning unkind brow And dart not scornful glances from those eyes To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor.	This disrespectful stance toward the man who is your lord, your king, your governor tarnishes your beauty the way the frosts of winter blights the land.
Such duty as the subject owes the prince, Even such a woman oweth to her husband.	A woman owes her husband the same loyalty a subject owes his king.
And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour, And not obedient to his honest will, What is she but a foul contending rebel And graceless traitor to her loving lord?	And when she is peevish and perverse, sullen, sour, and disobedient to his honest wishes, what is she but a loathsome, warlike rebel and an ungrateful traitor to her loving lord?
I am ashamed that women are so simple To offer war where they should kneel for peace; Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway When they are bound to serve, love, and obey.	I am ashamed that women are so foolish as to declare war when they should plead on their knees for peace, that they seek authority, supremacy, and power when they are under an obligation to serve, love, and obey.
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth, Unapt to toil and trouble in the world, But that our soft conditions and our hearts Should well agree with our external parts?	Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth, unfit for toil and trouble in the world, if not so that our soft qualities and our hearts should agree with our external parts?
Come, come, you froward and unable worms!	Come, come, you weak, ungovernable worms!
My mind hath been as big as one of yours, My heart as great, my reason haply more, To bandy word for word and frown for frown.	My spirit has been as proud as each of yours, my courage as great, and my reason perhaps even better suited to bandy words back and forth and exchange frown for frown.
But now I see our lances are but straws, Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare, That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.	But now I see our weapons are like straws, our strength like a straw’s weakness, and our weakness past comparison, so that we seem to be the thing we most are not.
Come on and kiss me, Kate.	Come on and kiss me, Kate.
Tis a good hearing when children are toward.	It’s nice to see children playing well together.
But a harsh hearing when women are froward.	But not so nice when women misbehave.
Come, Kate, we’ll to bed.	Come, Kate, let’s go to bed.
We three are married, but you two are sped.	We three are married, but you two are defeated.
Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tamed so.	It’s amazing, if I may say so, that she let herself be tamed.
Madam wife, they say that I have dreamed And slept above some fifteen year or more.	Madam wife, they say I’ve been dreaming or asleep for more than fifteen years.
Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me, Being all this time abandoned from your bed.	Yes, and it seemed twice as long to me, having been kept from your bed that whole time.
Tis much.—Servants, leave me and her alone.	That’s too long.—Servants, leave her and me alone.
Madam, undress you and come now to bed.	Now, madam, undress and come to bed.
Thrice noble lord, let me entreat of you To pardon me yet for a night or two, Or if not so, until the sun be set.	Thrice noble lord, I beg you to excuse me for another night or two—or at least until nightfall.
For your physicians have expressly charged, In peril to incur your former malady, That I should yet absent me from your bed.	Your doctors have expressly forbidden me to sleep with you, as there’s a risk that you might have a relapse.
I hope this reason stands for my excuse.	I hope this explanation will stand as my excuse.
Ay, it stands so that I may hardly tarry so long.	I’m not sure I can wait that long.
But I would be loath to fall into my dreams again.	Still, I’d hate to see my former dreams return.
Your Honor’s players, hearing your amendment, Are come to play a pleasant comedy, For so your doctors hold it very meet, Seeing too much sadness hath congealed your blood, And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy.	So I  Your Honor’s actors, hearing of your recovery, have come to perform a pleasing comedy for you—and your doctors approve wholeheartedly.
Therefore they thought it good you hear a play And frame your mind to mirth and merriment, Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.	So they think it’s a good idea for you to watch a play and direct your thoughts toward laughter and merriment—two strong preventive medicines that foster long life.
Let them play it.	Okay, bring on the play.
What, household stuff?	What, like stuff from a house?
It is a kind of history.	No, it’s a story.
Well, we’ll see ’t.	Well, let’s watch it.
We shall ne'er be younger.	We’re not getting any younger.
Pisa, renownèd for grave citizens, Gave me my being and my father first, A merchant of great traffic through the world, Vincentio, come of the Bentivolii.	I was born in Pisa, famous for its serious citizens, like my father before me; my father, Vincentio, a successful, world-traveled merchant, was one of the
I’ll pheeze you, in faith.	I’ll fix you, I swear.
A pair of stocks, you rogue!	You thug!
Y'are a baggage, the Slys are no rogues.	Read your history!
Therefore  You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?	We You won’t pay for the glasses you smashed?
No, not a denier.	No, not a penny.
Go by, Saint Jeronimy.	Get out of my face.
Go to thy cold bed and warm thee.	Go play with yourself.
I know my remedy.	I know my rights.
I’ll not budge an inch, boy.	I’m not moving an inch, pal.
Let him come, and kindly.	Let them come—I don’t care.
Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.	That’s good advice.
But stay awhile.	Wait!
What company is this?	Who are all these people?
Master, some show to welcome us to town.	Maybe it’s a parade to welcome us to town, master.
I' faith, sir, you shall never need to fear.	Don’t worry, I couldn’t care less.
But if it were, doubt not her care should be To comb your noddle with a three-legged stool And paint your face and use you like a fool.	The only possible interest I could take in you would be to hit you on the head with a stool, paint your face with blood, and make a fool out of you.
From all such devils, good Lord, deliver us!	May the good Lord keep me safe from all women like her!
And me too, good Lord!	Me too, Lord!
Maid’s mild behavior and sobriety.	What a spoiled little brat.
Sister, content you in my discontent.— Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe.	Sister, be happy in my unhappiness.—Sir, I will humbly obey you.
My books and instruments shall be my company, On them to look and practice by myself.	I’ll take comfort in my books and music, reading and practicing my instruments.
Hark, Tranio!	Listen Tranio!
Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?	That’s  Signior Baptista, will you really be this cruel?
Why will you mew her up, Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell And make her bear the penance of her tongue?	Why are you locking her away because of this fiend from hell, Signor Baptista?
And for I know she taketh most delight In music, instruments, and poetry, Schoolmasters will I keep within my house, Fit to instruct her youth.	And because I know how fond she is of music, playing her instruments, and poetry, I plan to hire live-in tutors for her.
And so farewell.—Katherina, you may stay, For I have more to commune with Bianca.	Katherina, you may stay.
Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not?	I don’t think so!
What, shall I be appointed hours as though, belike, I knew not what to take and what to leave, ha?	Am I to be dictated to, like a child?
You may go to the devil’s dam!	You can go straight to hell!
Farewell.	So long.
Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked parle, know now upon advice, it toucheth us both, that we may yet again have access to our fair mistress and be happy rivals in Bianca’s love, to labor and effect one thing specially.	That is, if we ever want to return to being rivals for Bianca’s love.
What’s that, I pray?	And that would be—?
Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.	To find a husband for her sister.
A husband?	A husband?
A devil!	You mean a devil!
I say a husband.	I mean a husband.
I say a devil.	I say a devil.
Think’st thou, Hortensio, though her father be very rich, any man is so very a fool to be married to hell?	Do you really think there’s a man fool enough to marry into hell—however rich the father is?
Tush, Gremio.	Oh, I don’t know.
Though it pass your patience and mine to endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good fellows in the world, an a man could light on them, would take her with all faults, and money enough.	Guys who’d take her with all her faults, provided there were enough money involved.
I cannot tell.	I don’t know.
How say you, Signior Gremio?	What do you say, Signior Gremio?
I am agreed, and would I had given him the best horse inv Padua to begin his wooing that would thoroughly woo her, wed her, and bed her, and rid the house of her!	This imaginary suitor for Katherina—I’d buy him the best horse in Padua if he’d get here quickly, woo her, marry her, take her to bed, and rid the house of her.
Come on.	Let’s go.
I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible That love should of a sudden take such hold?	Sir, is it possible that a person could fall in love so suddenly?
O Tranio, till I found it to be true, I never thought it possible or likely.	Oh, Tranio, until it happened to me, I never would have thought it possible.
Affection is not rated from the heart.	The heart won’t be reasoned with.
If love have touched you, naught remains but so:   Gramercies, lad, go forward.	If love has touched you, love has touched you—end of story.
This contents.	Yes, you’re right.
The rest will comfort, for thy counsel’s sound.	Please go on.
Master, you looked so longly on the maid, Perhaps you marked not what’s the pith of all.	I feel better already, and I know there’s more good advice where that came from.
Oh yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face Such as the daughter of Agenor had, That made great Jove to humble him to her hand When with his knees he kissed the Cretan strand.	Master, you were so focused on the girl herself, I wonder if you missed the main point here.
Saw you no more?	Oh no!
Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move And with her breath she did perfume the air.	Tranio, I saw her coral-pink lips move and perfume the air with her breath.
Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father’s he!	Oh, Tranio, what a cruel father he is.
But art thou not advised, he took some care To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?	Still, did you notice how ready he was to hire good tutors for her?
Ay, marry, am I, sir; and now ’tis plotted!	I did—and now I’ve got it!
I have it, Tranio!	Tranio, I think I’ve got it!
Master, for my hand, Both our inventions meet and jump in one.	I’ll bet we’re both thinking the same thing, master.
Tell me thine first.	Tell me your idea first.
You will be schoolmaster And undertake the teaching of the maid: That’s your device.	You will pretend to be a schoolmaster and offer to teach the girl.
It is.	It is.
May it be done?	Do you think it would work?
Not possible.	No, not a chance.
Tis hatched, and shall be so.	Enough!
When Biondello comes, he waits on thee, But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.	It’s obvious:  Here comes Biondello.
Where have I been?	Where have you been, boy?
Nay, how now, where are you?	Where have  Come here, boy.
Sirrah, come hither: ’tis no time to jest, And therefore frame your manners to the time.	It’s no time for jokes: sober up.
You understand me?	Understand?
Aye, sir.	Of course, sir.
And not a jot of “Tranio” in your mouth.	And you’re not to utter a syllable of Tranio’s name.
Would I were so too.	Wish I could say the same.
So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after, That Lucentio indeed had Baptista’s youngest daughter.	I’d second your wish if it automatically meant that Lucentio could have Baptista’s youngest daughter.
But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master’s, I advise You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies.	This is for your master’s sake, not mine.
When I am alone, why then I am Tranio; But in all places else, your master Lucentio.	When we’re by ourselves you can call me “Tranio.” Everywhere else, address me as your master Lucentio.
Tranio, let’s go.	Tranio, let’s go.
One thing more rests, that thyself execute, to make one among these wooers.	One last thing, and this is up to you.
If thou ask me why, sufficeth my reasons are both good and weighty.	You’ll have to woo Bianca like the rest.
My lord, you nod.	Don’t ask why.
You do not mind the play.	No, no.
A good matter, surely.	Very impressive.
Comes there any more of it?	Is there any more, or is that it?
Tis a very excellent piece of work, madam lady.	And what an excellent piece of work it is, too, madam lady!
Would ’twere done.	I wish it were over.
Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds.	Huntsman, look after my hounds.
Breathe Merriman, the poor cur is embossed, And couple Clowder with the deep-mouthed brach.	Let Merriman catch his breath—the poor dog’s foaming at the mouth.
Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord.	I think Belman is just as good, my lord.
Trust me, I take him for the better dog.	I swear he’s the better dog.
Thou art a fool.	You’re a fool.
If Echo were as fleet, I would esteem him worth a dozen such.	If Echo were as fast, he would be worth a dozen like Belman.
But sup them well and look unto them all.	But give them all a good dinner and look after them well.
Tomorrow I intend to hunt again.	I’ll go hunting again tomorrow, I think.
I will, my lord.	I will, my lord.
What’s here?	What’s this?
One dead, or drunk?	A drunkard or a corpse?
See, doth he breathe?	Check and see if he’s breathing.
He breathes, my lord.	He is, my lord.
Were he not warmed with ale, This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.	But this would be too cold a place to sleep if he hadn’t warmed himself with ale.
Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!	Alas, grim death, how vile and ugly your near-twin, sleep, is!
Sirs, I will practice on this drunken man.	What do you think?
Verona, for a while I take my leave, To see my friends in Padua, but of all My best belovèd and approvèd friend, Hortensio.	I’m off to visit my friends in Padua—particularly my best friend Hortensio.
And I trow this is his house.	And I think this is his house.
Here, sirrah Grumio.	Here, you there, Grumio.
Knock, I say.	Knock.
Knock, sir?	Knock, sir?
Whom should I knock?	Whom should I knock?
Is there any man has rebused your Worship?	Has anyone offended your Worship?
Knock you here, sir?	Moron!
Villain, I say, knock me at this gate And rap me well, or I’ll knock your knave’s pate.	I’m telling you to make a fist and pound.
My master is grown quarrelsome.	My master is being difficult.
How now, what’s the matter?	Say, what’s the trouble?
My old friend Grumio and my good friend Petruchio?	If it isn’t my old friend Grumio—and my dear friend Petruchio!
How do you all at Verona?	How’s everyone in Verona?
Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?	Hortensio, have you come to break up the fight?
Nay, ’tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin.	I don’t care what he told you in Latin.
I bade the rascal knock upon your gate And could not get him for my heart to do it.	I told him to knock at your gate and for the life of me could not get him to do it.
Knock at the gate?	Knock at the gate?
O heavens!	Oh, for Pete’s sake!
Spake you not these words plain: “Sirrah, knock me here, rap me here, knock me well, and knock me soundly”?	Didn’t you clearly say “Knock,” “pound,” and “put your fists to work”?
And come you now with “knocking at the gate”?	Now you say it was “Knock at the gate”?
Petruchio, patience.	I’m warning you.
I am Grumio’s pledge.	Easy, Petruchio.
Why, this' a heavy chance ’twixt him and you, Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.	I’ll vouch for Grumio.
And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?	Now, my dear friend, what lucky wind blows you in from Verona?
Such wind as scatters young men through the world To seek their fortunes farther than at home, Where small experience grows.	The wind that scatters young men throughout the world, encouraging them to seek their fortunes some place other than home, where there’s little to be found in the way of experience.
Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home, And so am come abroad to see the world.	I have money in my purse and property at home, so I’m off to see the world.
Thou’dst thank me but a little for my counsel; And yet I’ll promise thee she shall be rich, And very rich.	I doubt you’d thank me in the end, but she’s rich, all right, very rich.
But thou'rt too much my friend, And I’ll not wish thee to her.	But you’re too good a friend for me to wish her on you.
Signior Hortensio, ’twixt such friends as we Few words suffice.	Hortensio, good friends like us can get by on a few words.
I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife With wealth enough, and young and beauteous, Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman.	I can help you find a wife who’s rich, young, beautiful, and reared in a manner fit for a gentlewoman.
Her only fault, and that is faults enough, Is that she is intolerable curst, And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure That, were my state far worser than it is, I would not wed her for a mine of gold.	Her only flaw—and it’s a big one—is that she’s unbearable, a total witch, so much so that I wouldn’t think of marrying her myself, not even if I were in a worse fix than I am, not for a whole goldmine.
Hortensio, peace.	Hush, Hortensio.
Thou know’st not gold’s effect.	You don’t know what money can buy.
Her father is Baptista Minola, An affable and courteous gentleman.	Her father is Baptista Minola, a pleasant and courteous gentleman.
Her name is Katherina Minola, Renowned in Padua for her scolding tongue.	Her name is Katherina Minola, famous throughout Padua for her scolding tongue.
I know her father, though I know not her, And he knew my deceasèd father well.	I don’t know her, but I know her father and he knew mine well.
I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her, And therefore let me be thus bold with you To give you over at this first encounter, Unless you will accompany me thither.	I won’t sleep until I see her, Hortensio.
Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee, For in Baptista’s keep my treasure is.	Wait, Petruchio, I should go with you.
He hath the jewel of my life in hold, His youngest daughter, beautiful Bianca, And her withholds from me and other more, Suitors to her and rivals in my love, Supposing it a thing impossible, For those defects I have before rehearsed, That ever Katherina will be wooed.	His youngest daughter, the beautiful Bianca, is the jewel of my life, and he keeps her hidden away from me and other rivals for her hand.
Katherine the curst!” A title for a maid of all titles the worst.	Katherine the shrew!” That’s the worst thing you can call a young woman.
Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace, And offer me disguised in sober robes To old Baptista as a schoolmaster Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca, That so I may, by this device at least, Have leave and leisure to make love to her And, unsuspected, court her by herself.	Now my friend Petruchio will help me out, presenting me to old Baptista as a schoolmaster for Bianca well-versed in music.
Here’s no knavery!	I’ll disguise myself in somber robes.
Master, master, look about you.	Oh,  Master, master, look!
Who goes there, ha?	Who are these people?
Peace, Grumio.	Hush, Grumio.
It is the rival of my love.	It is my rival for Bianca.
Petruchio, stand by a while.	Petruchio, let’s stand over here awhile.
O this learning, what a thing it is!	Oh, what an excellent thing this learning is!
And you are well met, Signior Hortensio.	Good to see you, Signior Hortensio.
Trow you whither I am going?	Do you know where I’m going?
To Baptista Minola.	To Baptista Minola’s house.
Tis well.	That’s great.
And I have met a gentleman Hath promised me to help me to another, A fine musician to instruct our mistress.	And I have met a gentleman who promises to help me find a good music tutor to instruct our lady love.
Gremio, ’tis now no time to vent our love.	Gremio, this is no time to compete over how deeply we love Bianca.
So said, so done, is well.	That’s good, if he’ll really do it.
Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?	Have you told him all her faults, Hortensio?
I know she is an irksome brawling scold.	I know she is a hateful, brawling scold.
If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.	If that’s all, gentlemen, I see no problem.
No?	No?
Say’st me so, friend?	Tell me, friend.
What countryman?	Where are you from?
My father dead, my fortune lives for me.	My father’s dead, and his fortune is mine now.
And I do hope good days and long to see.	I hope to see good days—and many of them.
O sir, such a life with such a wife were strange!	Sir, such a life with such a wife is unlikely!
But if you have a stomach, to ’t, i' God’s name: You shall have me assisting you in all.	But if you have the stomach for it, you’ll have all the help from me you need.
But will you woo this wildcat?	Do you really mean to go after this wildcat?
Why came I hither but to that intent?	Why did I come here if not for that?
Have I not heard the sea, puffed up with winds, Rage like an angry boar chafèd with sweat?	I, who have survived storms at sea where the winds raged like wild animals?
Have I not heard great ordnance in the field, And heaven’s artillery thunder in the skies?	I, who have heard the rumble of guns in battle—and thunder in the sky (heaven’s version of artillery).
Hortensio, hark.	Listen, Hortensio.
And so we will, provided that he win her.	Absolutely—so long as he gets the girl.
I would I were as sure of a good dinner.	I wish I could be as certain of a good dinner.
He that has the two fair daughters—is ’t he you mean?	Is that the man you want?
Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.	But not the woman who scolds, anyway, I hope.
Sir, a word ere you go.	Sir, a word before you go.
Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?	Are you a suitor to the girl we speak of, yes or no?
An if I be, sir, is it any offense?	What if I am?
No, if without more words you will get you hence.	Not if you go away, there isn’t.
For this reason, if you’ll know: That she’s the choice love of Signior Gremio.	Because, if you must know, she’s been chosen by Signior Gremio.
That she’s the chosen of Signior Hortensio.	Because she’s been chosen by Signior Hortensio.
Softly, my masters.	Wait a minute, gentlemen.
If you be gentlemen, Do me this right: hear me with patience.	Be good enough to hear me out.
Baptista is a noble gentleman, To whom my father is not all unknown, And were his daughter fairer than she is, She may more suitors have, and me for one.	Baptista is a noble gentleman—one to whom my father is not completely unknown—and lovely as his daughter is, she is entitled to any number of suitors—myself among them.
Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.	I don’t think he’d have any choice, my lord.
It would seem strange unto him when he waked.	When he woke, he wouldn’t know where he was.
Even as a flatt'ring dream or worthless fancy.	It would be just like a nice daydream or fantasy.
Then take him up and manage well the jest.	Well, take him on up and we’ll try to pull it off.
Carry him gently to my fairest chamber And hang it round with all my wanton pictures.	Carry him to my best room—gently, so he doesn’t wake—and hang all my erotic paintings around him.
Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet.	Bathe his filthy head with warm, scented water.
My lord, I warrant you we will play our part As he shall think by our true diligence He is no less than what we say he is.	Convince him that he has been out of his mind—and when he says he’s out of his mind  My lord, I promise we will play our parts so skillfully that he will believe everything we tell him.
Fair Leda’s daughter had a thousand wooers; Then well one more may fair Bianca have.	The beautiful Helen of Troy had a thousand suitors.
This gentleman will out-talk us all.	This fellow will out-talk us all.
Hortensio, to what end are all these words?	Hortensio, what’s all this about?
Yea, leave that labor to great Hercules, And let it be more than Alcides' twelve.	Yes, leave that labor to great Hercules—it’s worse than the previous twelve put together.
Sir, you say well, and well you do conceive.	Sir, that’s well said and well thought out.
O excellent motion!	An excellent motion.
Fellows, let’s be gone.	Let’s go.
The motion’s good indeed and be it so.— Petruchio, I shall be your	I second that
Good sister, wrong me not nor wrong yourself, To make a bondmaid and a slave of me.	Dear sister, it’s unfair to me—and unfair to yourself—to turn me into a slave.
That I disdain.	That I won’t stand for.
See thou dissemble not.	And don’t lie.
Minion, thou liest.	You lying brat.
Is ’t not Hortensio?	It’s Hortensio, isn’t it?
Oh, then belike you fancy riches more.	Oh, I see.
You will have Gremio to keep you fair.	You’ll live in luxury with Gremio.
Is it for him you do envy me so?	Is it because of
What, in my sight?—Bianca, get thee in.	What, in my presence?
What, will you not suffer me?	You mean you don’t even want to hear my side?
Talk not to me.	Don’t talk to me.
But who comes here?	Now what?
Good morrow, neighbor Baptista.	Good morning, neighbor Baptista.
Good morrow, neighbor Gremio.—God save you, gentlemen!	Good morning, neighbor Gremio.
And you, good sir.	And to you, good sir.
Pray, have you not a daughter Called Katherina, fair and virtuous?	Tell me, don’t you have a virtuous and lovely daughter named Katherina?
I have a daughter, sir, called Katherina.	I have a daughter named Katherina, sir.
You wrong me, Signior Gremio.	Please, Signior Gremio.
Give me leave.— I am a gentleman of Verona, sir, That hearing of her beauty and her wit, Her affability and bashful modesty, Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior, Am bold to show myself a forward guest Within your house, to make mine eye the witness Of that report which I so oft have heard.	Allow me to continue.—I am a gentleman of Verona, sir, who, hearing of your daughter’s beauty and wit, her friendly disposition and bashful modesty, her uncommon virtues and her mild behavior, have taken the liberty of presenting myself as a guest at your house in the hope of seeing for myself if what I’ve heard is true.
You’re welcome, sir, and he for your good sake.	You and he are both welcome, sir.
But for my daughter Katherine, this I know, She is not for your turn, the more my grief.	As for my daughter Katherine, this much I know: she’s not for you—more’s the pity.
I see you do not mean to part with her, Or else you like not of my company.	I see you don’t intend to part with her—or perhaps you don’t like my company.
Mistake me not.	Don’t misunderstand me, sir.
I speak but as I find.	I’m just stating the facts as I see them.
Whence are you, sir?	Where are you from?
What may I call your name?	What’s your name?

I doubt it not, sir, but you will curse your wooing.— Neighbor, this is a gift very grateful, I am sure of it.	No doubt, but you may be going about it the wrong way—Neighbor, this gift is very gracious, I’m sure.
To express the like kindness, myself, that have been more kindly beholding to you than any, freely give unto you this young scholar	I myself, who am more indebted to you than anyone, have brought you this young scholar
A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio.	Many thanks, Signior Gremio.
Welcome, good Cambio.	Welcome, good Cambio.
Lucentio is your name.	Your name is Lucentio, you say.
Of whence, I pray?	Of what city, may I ask?

You are very welcome, sir.	You are very welcome here, sir.
We will go walk a little in the orchard, And then to dinner.	Let’s take a little walk in the orchard before dinner.
You are passing welcome, And so I pray you all to think yourselves.	You are all most welcome here; please make yourselves at home.
Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste, And every day I cannot come to woo.	Signior Baptista, I’m actually in a bit of a hurry.
You knew my father well, and in him me, Left solely heir to all his lands and goods, Which I have bettered rather than decreased.	You knew my father well; therefore, you know me, the sole heir to all his property and possessions, which I have added to rather than depleted.
Then tell me, if I get your daughter’s love, What dowry shall I have with her to wife?	So, tell me, assuming I win your daughter’s love, what dowry would she bring to the marriage?
After my death, the one half of my lands, And, in possession, twenty thousand crowns.	Twenty thousand crowns now, and half my lands after my death.
Let specialties be therefore drawn between us, That covenants may be kept on either hand.	Let’s have explicit contracts drawn up to ensure that both sides keep their promises.
Ay, when the special thing is well obtained, That is, her love, for that is all in all.	That counts for everything.
Why, that is nothing.	Oh, that’s nothing, believe me, sir.
For I tell you, father, I am as peremptory as she proud-minded; And where two raging fires meet together, They do consume the thing that feeds their fury.	I’m as commanding as she is proud, and when two raging fires meet, they end up consuming the very thing that kindled them.
So I to her and so she yields to me, For I am rough and woo not like a babe.	I’m that great gust to her fire.
Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed.	Well, good luck!
But be thou armed for some unhappy words.	But prepare yourself for some unpleasantness.
Ay, to the proof, as mountains are for winds, That shakes not, though they blow perpetually.	Mountains don’t tremble, however much the wind may blow!
How now, my friend, why dost thou look so pale?	Why so pale, my friend?
What, will my daughter prove a good musician?	Will my daughter be a good musician, do you think?
I think she’ll sooner prove a soldier.	I think she’ll be a better soldier.
Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?	You don’t think you can teach her?
I’ll fume with them!” And with that word she struck me on the head, And through the instrument my pate made way,	I’ll give you frets!” With that, she clobbers me with the lute so that my head goes right through,
Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench.	I like this girl!
I love her ten times more than e'er I did.	Now I want her more than ever.
Oh, how I long to have some chat with her!	I can’t wait to meet her!
I pray you do.	Please do.
I’ll attend her here And woo her with some spirit when she comes.	I’ll wait for her here and when she comes I’ll take a novel approach with her.
Say that she rail; why then I’ll tell her plain She sings as sweetly as a nightingale.	If she rants, I’ll tell her that she sings as sweetly as a nightingale.
Say that she frown; I’ll say she looks as clear As morning roses newly washed with dew.	If she glares, I’ll say her brow is as clear as roses newly washed with morning dew.
Say she be mute and will not speak a word; Then I’ll commend her volubility, And say she uttereth piercing eloquence.	If she is silent and won’t speak at all, I’ll praise her chattiness and say she speaks with piercing eloquence.
If she do bid me pack, I’ll give her thanks, As though she bid me stay by her a week.	If she orders me to go, I’ll thank her warmly as if she’d just offered to put me up for a week.
If she deny to wed, I’ll crave the day When I shall ask the banns and when be marrièd.	If she refuses my proposal, I’ll tell her how much I’m looking forward to the announcement and the wedding.
Take him up gently, and to bed with him, And each one to his office when he wakes.	Carry him gently to bed, and every man be ready at his post when he awakes.
Sirrah, go see what trumpet ’tis that sounds.	Go, lad, and find out what the trumpet’s sounding for.

We thank your Honor.	We thank your Honor.
Do you intend to stay with me tonight?	Were you thinking of spending the night here?
So please your Lordship to accept our duty.	Yes, if that would be all right with your Lordship.
With all my heart.	By all means.
This fellow I remember Since once he played a farmer’s eldest son.	I remember this fellow—he once played the eldest son of a farmer.
Twas where you wooed the gentlewoman so well.	It was the play in which you wooed the gentlewoman so successfully.
I have forgot your name, but sure that part Was aptly fitted and naturally performed.	I have forgotten your name, but you were well cast in the role and played it convincingly.
Good morrow, Kate—for that’s your name, I hear.	Good morning, Kate, for I hear that’s what you’re called.
Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing.	Is that what you’ve heard?
Moved,” in good time.	Driven?” Really?
I knew you at the first You were a moveable.	I had you figured for a piece of furniture.
Why, what’s a moveable?	What do you mean by “furniture”?

Alas, good Kate, I will not burden thee, For knowing thee to be but young and light— Too light for such a swain as you to catch, And yet as heavy as my weight should be.	I know how  Too light for a lout like you to catch—though no lighter than I should be.
Should be”—should buzz!	Should be?
If I be waspish, best beware my sting.	If I’m a wasp, look out for my stinger.
My remedy is then to pluck it out.	All I have to do is remove it.
Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies.	True, if a fool such as yourself could find it.
Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting?	Everyone knows where a wasp wears its stinger.
In his tail.	In its tail.
In his tongue.	No, in its tongue.
Whose tongue?	Whose tongue?
Yours, if you talk of tales.	Yours, if we’re talking about  I’m leaving.
What, with my tongue in your tail?	You’re leaving with my tongue in your tail?

I care not.	Well, that doesn’t worry me.
Let me go.	Let me go.
No, not a whit.	No, not a bit.
I find you passing gentle.	I find you quite gentle.
Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen, And now I find report a very liar.	I was told that you were violent, proud, and sullen.
Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance, Nor bite the lip as angry wenches will, Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk.	You haven’t got it in you to frown or look displeased or bite your lip as angry women do.
But thou with mildness entertain’st thy wooers, With gentle conference, soft and affable.	No, you entertain your suitors with mild and gentle conversation, quiet and pleasant.

Show us the way without further delay.—Trinculo, since the king and all our comrades are drowned, we’re the heirs of this place.—Here, carry my wine bottle.—Trinculo, my buddy, we’ll get that bottle refilled soon enough.
A howling monster, a drunken monster.	A loud-mouthed, drunken monster.
O brave monster!	Good monster!
Lead the way.	Show us the way.
Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren ground: long heath, brown furze, anything.	Right now I’d give a thousand
Some kinds of baseness Are nobly undergone.	Some kinds of lowly activities are done for noble reasons.
And most poor matters Point to rich ends.	And you can do poor things that lead to rich results.
This my mean task Would be as heavy to me as odious, but The mistress which I serve quickens what’s dead And makes my labors pleasures.	This hard work would be boring and nasty to me, but I’m working for a mistress who makes me enjoy my labor.
Oh, she is Ten times more gentle than her father’s crabbed, And he’s composed of harshness.	Oh, she’s ten times nicer than her father is mean, and he’s the height of crabbiness.
I must remove Some thousands of these logs and pile them up, Upon a sore injunction.	I have thousands of logs to take away and pile up, on strict orders from him.
My sweet mistress Weeps when she sees me work, and says such baseness Had never like executor.	My sweet darling cries when she sees me work and tells me that such a wonderful man never performed such lowly tasks before.
I forget, But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labors, Most busiest when I do it.	These sweet thoughts relieve me and refresh me, especially when I’m slaving away busily.
Alas now, pray you, Work not so hard.	Now, please, I beg you, don’t work so hard.
I would the lightning had Burnt up those logs that you are enjoined to pile!	I wish the lightning had burned up all those logs that you’ve been ordered to stack!
Pray, set it down and rest you.	Please put that log down and rest a while.
When this burns, 'Twill weep for having wearied you.	When this wood burns, it’ll weep for making you tired.
My father Is hard at study.	My father’s studying hard, so he won’t see you.
Pray now, rest yourself.	So please rest.
He’s safe for these three hours.	We’re safe from my father for at least three hours.
O most dear mistress, The sun will set before I shall discharge What I must strive to do.	Oh, my dear mistress, I won’t be able to finish this work until sunset at the earliest.
If you’ll sit down, I’ll bear your logs the while.	If you sit down, I’ll carry your logs a while.
Pray, give me that.	Please give me that.
I’ll carry it to the pile.	I’ll take it over to the pile.
It would become me As well as it does you, and I should do it With much more ease, for my good will is to it And yours it is against.	I’d be as right for the job as you are, and I’d do it more easily, since I’d have good will on my side.
You look wearily.	You look tired.
I do beseech you— Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers— What is your name?	I beg you to tell me your name so I can use it in my prayers.
Miranda.—O my father, I have broke your hest to say so!	Miranda.—Oh father, I’ve disobeyed you by telling him that!
Full many a lady I have eyed with best regard and many a time	I’ve looked at many ladies with pleasure, and been
For several virtues Have I liked several women.	But with you it’s different.
But you, O you, So perfect and so peerless, are created Of every creature’s best.	You’re perfect, without a rival in the world, made up of the best qualities of every creature.
I do not know One of my sex, no woman’s face remember— Save, from my glass, mine own.	I’ve never known any woman or seen a woman’s face—except my own in the mirror.
Nor have I seen More that I may call men than you, good friend, And my dear father.	And I’ve never met any men besides you and my father.
I am in my condition A prince, Miranda—I do think, a king; I would, not so!—and would no more endure This wooden slavery than to suffer The flesh-fly blow my mouth.	I’m a prince by birth, Miranda—maybe even a king now; though I wish I weren’t—and normally I wouldn’t put up with carrying these logs any more than I’d let flies breed in my mouth.
Hear my soul speak.	But I’ll tell you something from my soul.
The very instant that I saw you did My heart fly to your service, there resides To make me slave to it, and for your sake Am I this patient log-man.	The second I saw you, my heart rushed to serve you and be your slave, so here I am now, a patient log-man.
Do you love me?	Do you love me?
O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound And crown what I profess with kind event	Oh heaven, oh earth, witness what I’m about to say, and reward me if I tell the truth!
If I speak true!	If I’m lying, then
I Beyond all limit of what else i' th' world Do love, prize, honor you.	More than anything else in the world, I love you, value you, and honor you.
I am a fool To weep at what I am glad of.	Look at me crying—what a fool I am to cry at what makes me happy.
Wherefore weep you?	Why are you crying?
At mine unworthiness, that dare not offer What I desire to give, and much less take What I shall die to want.	I’m crying at how unworthy I am to give you what I want to give you and to take what I’m dying to have.
But this is trifling, And all the more it seeks to hide itself The bigger bulk it shows.	The more I try to hide what I’m feeling, the bigger it gets.
I am your wife if you will marry me.	I’ll be your wife if you’ll have me.
If not, I’ll die your maid.	Otherwise, I’ll die a virgin, devoted to you.
To be your fellow You may deny me, but I’ll be your servant Whether you will or no.	You can refuse to make me your spouse, but I’ll be your servant whether you want me to or not.
My mistress, dearest, and I thus humble ever.	You’ll be my wife, dearest, and I’ll serve you forever.
My husband, then?	Will you be my husband, then?
A thousand thousand!	A million goodbyes to you.
I’ll to my book, For yet ere supper-time must I perform Much business appertaining.	Now it’s time to get back to my studying, since I have a lot of serious business to take care of before dinner.
Tell not me.	Don’t tell me that.
When the butt is out, we will drink water.	When the barrel’s empty, we’ll drink water.
Not a drop before.	Not one drop sooner.
Therefore bear up and board 'em.—Servant- monster, drink to me.	Therefore, drink up.—Servant-monster, drink a toast to me.
Servant-monster”?	Servant monster”?
The folly of this island.	What a crazy island this is.
They say there’s but five upon this isle.	They say there are only five people on it.
We are three of them.	We’re three of them.
If th' other two be brained like us, the state totters.	If the other two are as loopy as we are, our country’s in bad shape.
Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee.	Drink when I order you, servant-monster.
Thy eyes are almost set in thy head.	Your eyes look like they’ve sunk into your head.
Where should they be set else?	Where else should his eyes be, if not in his head?
He were a brave monster indeed, if they were set in his tail.	He’d be quite a monster if his eyes were in his tail.
For my part, the sea cannot drown me.	My man—monster is so drunk he can’t talk.
He’s no standard.	He’s not standing straight enough to hold a flag.
We’ll not run, Monsieur Monster.	We’re not going to run in our army, Monsieur Monster.
Nor go neither.	Or walk either.
But you’ll lie like dogs, and yet say nothing neither.	You’ll just lie there like sleeping dogs and say nothing.
Mooncalf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest a good mooncalf.	Monster sweetie, be a good monster and just speak once.
How does thy honor?	How is your Highness?
Let me lick thy shoe.	Let me lick your shoe.
Lord,” quoth he?	Lord,” he calls you?
That a monster should be such a natural!	What an idiot that monster is!
Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head.	Trinculo, speak politely.
If you prove a mutineer, the next tree.	If you mutiny against me, I’ll hang you from the next tree.
I thank my noble lord.	Thank you, my noble lord.
Wilt thou be pleased to hearken once again to the suit I made to thee?	Now would you please listen once again to the request I made to you earlier?
I will stand, and so shall Trinculo.	I’ll stand, and so will Trinculo.
Thou liest.	You lie.
Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in ’s tale, by this hand, I will supplant some of your teeth.	Trinculo, if you interrupt him any more, I swear I’ll knock some teeth out of your head.
Why, I said nothing.	I didn’t say anything.
Mum, then, and no more.	Okay, just stay quiet.
Proceed.	Go on.
I say, by sorcery he got this isle.	I was telling you he used witchcraft to take this island.
From me he got it.	He stole it from me.
If thy greatness will Revenge it on him—for I know thou darest, But this thing dare not— That’s most certain.	If your highness is willing, take revenge on him for that—because I know you’re brave enough, I don’t dare to— That’s for sure.
Thou shalt be lord of it and I’ll serve thee.	You’ll be lord of the island then, and I’ll be your servant.
How now shall this be compassed?	And how would we go about doing that?
Canst thou bring me to th' party?	Can you bring me to him?
Yea, yea, my lord.	Yes, yes, my lord.
I’ll yield him thee asleep, Where thou mayst knock a nail into his head.	I’ll take you to where he sleeps, and you can pound a nail into his head.
Thou liest.	You lie.
Thou canst not.	You can’t do that.
What a pied ninny’s this!—Thou scurvy patch!— I do beseech thy greatness, give him blows And take his bottle from him.	What an idiot this guy is!—You’re a rotten piece of work!—I beg your highness, beat him up and take his wine bottle from him.
When that’s gone, He shall drink naught but brine, for I’ll not show him Where the quick freshes are.	When he loses that, he’ll be drinking salt water, since I’ll never tell him where the freshwater springs are.
Trinculo, run into no further danger.	Trinculo, watch out.
Interrupt the monster one word further, and, by this hand, I’ll turn my mercy out o' doors and make a stockfish of thee.	If you interrupt this monster with one more word, I’ll beat you like a piece of salted fish.
Why, what did I?	What did I do?
I did nothing.	I didn’t do anything.
I’ll go farther off.	I need to get away from you.
Didst thou not say he lied?	Didn’t you call him a liar?
Thou liest.	You lie.
I did not give the lie.	I didn’t accuse you of lying.
Out o' your wits and hearing too?	Are you out of your mind and deaf too?
A pox o' your bottle!	Damn your wine!
Ha, ha, ha!	Ha, ha, ha!
Now, forward with your tale.—Prithee, stand farther off.	Now go ahead and tell me the rest of your story.—Please go stand farther away.
Beat him enough.	Beat him up.
After a little time, I’ll beat him too.	After a little while, I’ll beat him too.
Why, as I told thee, ’tis a custom with him, I' th' afternoon to sleep.	Just as I told you, he usually sleeps in the afternoon.
There thou mayst brain him, Having first seized his books; or with a log Batter his skull; or paunch him with a stake; Or cut his weasand with thy knife.	At that time you can smash in his skull after seizing his books; or you can bash his skull with a log; or you can stab him in the belly; or cut his windpipe.
Remember First to possess his books, for without them He’s but a sot, as I am, nor hath not One spirit to command.	Just remember to grab his books first, since without them he’s just a poor fool like me, and can’t command a single spirit.
They all do hate him As rootedly as I.	All the spirits hate him as much as I do.
Burn but his books.	Be sure to burn his magic books.
He has brave utensils—for so he calls them— Which when he has a house, he’ll deck withal.	He has some wonderful home furnishings—that’s what he calls them—that he’ll use to decorate his house when he gets one.
And that most deeply to consider is The beauty of his daughter.	The most important thing for you to think about is how beautiful his daughter is.
He himself Calls her a nonpareil.	He says she has no equal.
I never saw a woman, But only Sycorax my dam and she.	I never saw a woman except her and Sycorax, my mother.
But she as far surpasseth Sycorax As great’st does least.	But Miranda is so much more beautiful, you can’t even compare the two.
Is it so brave a lass?	Is she really that wonderful?
Ay, lord.	Yes, my lord.
Monster, I will kill this man.	Monster, I’ll kill this man.
His daughter and I will be king and queen—save our graces!—and Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys.—Dost thou like the plot, Trinculo?	His daughter and I will be king and queen—God protect us!—and you and Trinculo will be our governors.—Do you like that idea, Trinculo?
Excellent.	Excellent.
Give me thy hand.	Give me your hand.
I am sorry I beat thee.	I’m sorry I hit you.
But while thou livest, keep a good tongue in thy head.	But try to control your speech.
Within this half hour will he be asleep.	In a half an hour he’ll be asleep.
Wilt thou destroy him then?	Will you kill him then?
If by your art, my dearest father, you have Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.	Dear father, if you caused this terrible storm with your magic powers, please put an end to it.
The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch, But that the sea, mounting to th' welkin’s cheek, Dashes the fire out.	The sky’s so dark it looks like it would rain down boiling hot tar if the sea weren’t swelling up to the sky to put its fire out.
Oh, I have suffered With those that I saw suffer.	Oh, I suffered along with all the men I watched suffer!
A brave vessel Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her Dashed all to pieces.	A fine ship, with some good people in it, I’m sure, smashed to pieces.
Oh, the cry did knock Against my very heart!	Their dying shouts broke my heart!
Poor souls, they perished.	The poor people died.
Had I been any god of power, I would Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere It should the good ship so have swallowed and The fraughting souls within her.	If I’d been a god I would’ve let the sea sink inside the earth before it had a chance to swallow up that ship and all the people it was carrying.
Be collected.	Calm down.
No more amazement.	There’s nothing to get upset about.
Tell your piteous heart There’s no harm done.	No harm was done.
Oh, woe the day!	Oh, what a horrible day!
No harm.	There was no harm, I’m telling you.
More to know Did never meddle with my thoughts.	It never occurred to me to imagine there was anything more to know.
Ay, on mine honor.	Yes, I swear.
Thou makest me merry.	You make me so happy.
I am full of pleasure.	I’m full of joy.
Let us be jocund.	Let’s be light-hearted.
At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any reason.— Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.	I’ll do anything you ask, monster, anything reasonable.—Come on, Trinculo, let’s sing.
That’s not the tune.	That’s not the tune I had in mind.
What is this same?	What’s this song?
O, forgive me my sins!	Oh, forgive all my sins!
Art thou afeard?	Are you scared?
No, monster, not I.	No, monster, not me.
Be not afeard.	Don’t be scared.
This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall have my music for nothing.	This’ll be a wonderful kingdom to live in, where they play music for free.
When Prospero is destroyed.	As soon as you kill Prospero.
That shall be by and by.	That’ll happen soon enough.
I remember the story.	I remember the plan.
The sound is going away.	The sound is going away.
Let’s follow it, and after do our work.	But let’s follow it, and then do our dirty work afterward.
Lead, monster; we’ll follow.	Lead us, monster; we’ll follow.
I would I could see this taborer.	I wish I could see this invisible drummer.
He lays it on.	He really plays well.
Wilt come?	Are you coming monster?
My old bones ache.	My old bones are tired.
Here’s a maze trod indeed Through forthrights and meanders.	We’re wandering in a maze.
By your patience, I needs must rest me.	If you don’t mind, I need to rest a bit.
Old lord, I cannot blame thee, Who am myself attached with weariness To th' dulling of my spirits.	I can’t blame you, old lord.
Sit down and rest.	Sit down and rest.
He is drowned Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks Our frustrate search on land.	We’re searching on land, but he’s lost in the sea.
Well, let him go.	We have to give up and let him go.
What harmony is this?	What’s that music?
My good friends, hark!	My friends, listen.
Marvelous sweet music!	What marvelous music!
Give us kind keepers, heavens!	Heaven help us!
What were these?	What were those things?
Now I will believe That there are unicorns, that in Arabia There is one tree, the phoenix' throne, one phoenix At this hour reigning there.	Now I’ll believe that unicorns exist, and that there’s a tree in Arabia where the phoenix lives.
Travelers ne'er did lie, Though fools at home condemn 'em.	Travelers have never told lies, no matter what the fools at home accuse them of.
If in Naples I should report this now, would they believe me?	If I told them about this back in Naples, would they believe me?
If I should say, I saw such islanders— For, certes, these are people of the island— Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet note, Their manners are more gentle-kind than of Our human generation you shall find Many—nay, almost any.	I’d tell them that I saw natives like these—since they must be natives—who are graceful and well-mannered even if they’re monstrous to look at, kinder than most human beings you might find— kinder than almost any human.
They vanished strangely.	They vanished strangely.
No matter, since They have left their viands behind, for we have stomachs.	It’s all right, since they left their food behind, and we’re hungry.
Will ’t please you taste of what is here?	Would you like to taste the banquet?
Not I.	Not me.
Faith, sir, you need not fear.	I assure you, sir, there’s nothing to be afraid of.
Brother, my lord the duke, Stand to and do as we.	Brother, Duke, please have some food.
Oh, it is monstrous, monstrous.	Oh, it’s horrible, horrible.
Methought the billows spoke and told me of it, The winds did sing it to me, and the thunder, That deep and dreadful organ pipe, pronounced The name of Prosper.	I thought the clouds were talking to me, the winds were singing to me, and the thunder, like an awful organ pipe, roared Prospero’s name.
It did bass my trespass.	It sang about my crimes.
Therefore my son i' th' ooze is bedded, and I’ll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded And with him there lie mudded.	I’ll go join him there, going down deeper than any anchor ever sank, and lie with him dead in the mud.
But one fiend at a time, I’ll fight their legions o'er.	I’ll fight every one of these devils if I have to, one at a time.
I’ll be thy second.	I’ll back you up.
All three of them are desperate.	All three of them are crazy with despair.
Their great guilt, Like poison given to work a great time after, Now 'gins to bite the spirits.	Their guilt is finally starting to gnaw at them, like a slow-acting poison.
I do beseech you That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly And hinder them from what this ecstasy May now provoke them to.	Those of you who are young and active, I beg you to follow them and keep them from doing the crazy things their guilt might push them to do.
Follow, I pray you.	Follow them, please.
But If thou dost break her virgin knot before All sanctimonious ceremonies may With full and holy rite be ministered, No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall To make this contract grow, but barren hate, Sour-eyed disdain, and discord shall bestrew The union of your bed with weeds so loathly That you shall hate it both.	But if you have sex with her before the marriage ceremony takes place, the heavens will not bless your relationship, but will overwhelm you with hate, contempt, and discord, and will poison your marriage bed so that you both grow to loathe it.
Fairly spoke.	You’ve said it well.
Sit then and talk with her.	So have a seat and talk to her.
She is thine own.— What, Ariel!	She’s yours.—Come, Ariel!
My industrious servant, Ariel!	My trusty servant, Ariel!
What would my potent master?	What does my powerful master wish for?
Here I am.	I’m here.
Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service Did worthily perform, and I must use you In such another trick.	You and your fellow spirits did your last assignment well, and now I need your help again.
Go bring the rabble, O'er whom I give thee power, here to this place.	Go bring them all here; I give you power over them.
It is my promise, And they expect it from me.	I’ve promised them I would, and they’re expecting it.
Presently?	Right now?
Ay, with a twink.	Yes, right away.
Before you can say “Come” and “Go,” And breathe twice and cry “So, so!” Each one, tripping on his toe,	Before you can say “Come” and “Go,” And breathe twice, and shout “So, so!” Each one of your servants will rush here,
Tis time I should inform thee farther.	It’s time for you to know the whole story.
Lend thy hand And pluck my magic garment from me.	Give me a hand and help me off with this magic cloak.
Not yet.”      The hour’s now come.	Not yet.” Well, the time has come.
Canst thou remember A time before we came unto this cell?	Can you remember the time before you came to live in this shack?
I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not Out three years old.	I doubt it, since you weren’t even three at the time.
Certainly, sir, I can.	Sure I can, father.
By what?	What do you remember?
By any other house or person?	A house, a person?
Of anything the image tell me that Hath kept with thy remembrance.	Tell me anything you remember.
Dearly my delicate Ariel.	I love you dearly, Ariel.
Do not approach Till thou dost hear me call.	Don’t come near till you hear me call you.
Well, I conceive.	All right, I understand.
I warrant you, sir, The white cold virgin snow upon my heart Abates the ardor of my liver.	I assure you, sir, the tender love I feel in my heart is stronger than the sexual passions stirring down below.
Well.— Now come, my Ariel!	Good.—Now come, Ariel!
Bring a corollary, Rather than want a spirit.	Better to have an extra servant on hand than be understaffed.
Appear and pertly!— No tongue.	Appear before me now quickly— No talking.
All eyes!	Just watch!
Be silent.	Be quiet.
Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats, and peas; Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep, And flat meads thatched with stover, them to keep; Thy banks with pionèd and twillèd brims,	I have come to announce that Juno has asked you, Ceres, goddess of the fields and the earth, to leave your rich farms of wheat, rye, barley, oats, and peas, the hills where the

Tell me, heavenly bow, If Venus or her son, as thou dost know, Do now attend the queen?	Tell me, rainbow, do you know if either Venus, the goddess of love, or her son, Cupid, is accompanying Queen Juno?
Since they did plot The means that dusky Dis my daughter got, Her and her blind boy’s scandaled company I have forsworn.	Ever since Venus and her blind son plotted a way for the god of the underworld to steal my daughter away for half the year, I swore I’d never speak to them again.
Of her society Be not afraid.	Don’t be afraid of her company.
I met her deity Cutting the clouds towards Paphos, and her son Dove-drawn with her.	I met Venus as she was with her son on her way to her home on Paphos, in a carriage pulled by doves.
Here thought they to have done Some wanton charm upon this man and maid, Whose vows are that no bed-right shall be paid Till Hymen’s torch be lighted—but in vain.	They were planning to pull a mischievous trick on Ferdinand and Miranda, who have sworn not to sleep together till their wedding day.
Mars’s hot minion is returned again.	But their trick failed.

May I be bold To think these spirits?	Are these spirits we see before us?

The minute of their plot Is almost come.—Well done.	The moment they planned to act is almost here.
Never till this day Saw I him touched with anger so distempered.	I’ve never seen him like this.
We are such stuff As dreams are made on, and our little life Is rounded with a sleep.	We are all made of dreams, and our life stretches from sleep before birth to sleep after death.
Sir, I am vexed.	Sir, I’m upset.
Bear with my weakness.	Please put up with my weakness.
My old brain is troubled.	My old brain is troubled.
Be not disturbed with my infirmity.	Don’t be disturbed by my illness.
If you be pleased, retire into my cell And there repose.	If you like, you can rest a while in my room.
A turn or two I’ll walk To still my beating mind.	I’ll go for a short walk to calm down my feverish mind.
We wish your peace.	We hope you feel better and find some peace.
Come with a thought.	Come, Ariel—I summon you with a thought.
I thank thee, Ariel.	Thank you, Ariel.
Come.	Come.
Thy thoughts I cleave to.	I obey all your thoughts.
What’s thy pleasure?	What do you wish?
Spirit, We must prepare to meet with Caliban.	Spirit, we have to get ready to meet with Caliban.
Ay, my commander.	Yes, my master.
When I presented Ceres, I thought to have told thee of it, but I feared Lest I might anger thee.	When I was putting on the Ceres show, I thought of reminding you about Caliban, but I was afraid of upsetting you.
Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?	Tell me again, where did you leave those lowlifes?
I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking, So full of valor that they smote the air For breathing in their faces, beat the ground For kissing of their feet—yet always bending Towards their project.	I told you, sir, they were totally drunk, so puffed up with courage that they were getting angry at the air for blowing in their faces, and beating the ground for touching their feet—yet even when drunk, they kept their plan firmly in mind.
Then I beat my tabor, At which, like unbacked colts, they pricked their ears, Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses As they smelt music.	Then I beat my drum, at which point they pricked up their ears and opened their eyes, looking around for the source of my music.
So I charmed their ears That, calflike, they my lowing followed through Toothed briers, sharp furzes, pricking gorse, and thorns, Which entered their frail shins.	I enchanted them so thoroughly that they followed me through thorn bushes and prickly shrubs that tore up their shins.
At last I left them I' th' filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell, There dancing up to th' chins, that the foul lake O'erstunk their feet.	In the end I left them standing in the smelly pond behind your room, with the stinking water covering them up to their chins.
This was well done, my bird.	Good job, my little one.

Monster, your fairy, which you say is a harmless fairy, has done little better than played the jack with us.	Hey monster, the spirit you’ve been talking about, the one you call harmless, has been playing tricks on us.
Monster, I do smell all horse piss, at which my nose is in great indignation.	Monster, I smell like horse piss, which is making my nose pretty upset.
So is mine.—Do you hear, monster?	Mine too.—Are you listening, monster?

Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints With dry convulsions, shorten up their sinews With agèd cramps, and more pinch-spotted make them Than pard or cat o' mountain.	Ariel, go order my goblin servants to make these fellows' bones ache, give them muscle cramps all over, and give them more bruises than leopards have spots.

How’s the day?	What time is it?

The king, His brother, and yours, abide all three distracted, And the remainder mourning over them, Brimful of sorrow and dismay.	The king, his brother, and your brother are all waiting there in a crazed state of mind, and the rest are grieving over them, sad and astonished.
But chiefly Him that you termed, sir, “the good old Lord Gonzalo,” His tears run down his beard like winter’s drops From eaves of reeds.	Good old lord Gonzalo,” as you call him, is saddest of all, with tears running down his beard.
Your charm so strongly works 'em That if you now beheld them, your affections Would become tender.	Your magic spell has such an effect on them that if you saw them now, you’d feel sorry for them.
Dost thou think so, spirit?	Do you think so, spirit?

With his own lightning bolts; I’ve shaken up the sturdy cliffs and uprooted pines and cedars; I’ve opened up graves and awakened the corpses sleeping in them, letting them out with my powerful magic.
But this rough magic I here abjure, and when I have required Some heavenly music, which even now I do, To work mine end upon their senses that This airy charm is for, I’ll break my staff, Bury it certain fathoms in the earth, And deeper than did ever plummet sound I’ll drown my book.	But I surrender all this magic now, when I’ve summoned some heavenly music to cast a spell, as I’m doing now, I’ll break my staff and bury it far underground, and throw my book of magic spells deeper into the sea than any anchor ever sank.

I perceive these lords At this encounter do so much admire That they devour their reason and scarce think Their eyes do offices of truth, their words Are natural breath.—But howsoev'r you have Been justled from your senses, know for certain That I am Prospero and that very duke Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely Upon this shore where you were wracked, was landed, To be the lord on ’t.	These lords seem so astonished that they’ve lost their use of reason and can hardly believe what they see with their own eyes.—But whatever the reason for your losing your senses, you can know for sure that I’m Prospero, that same duke who was kicked out of Milan and landed on this same island where you landed, and became the lord of it.

he whom next thyself Of all the world I loved and to him put The manage of my state, as at that time Through all the signories it was the first, And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed In dignity, and for the liberal arts Without a parallel.	My brother whom—aside from you—I loved more than anyone else in the world, I trusted to run my state, which at that time was the strongest in the land, and Prospero the number one duke, famous for my dignity and my education.
Those being all my study, The government I cast upon my brother And to my state grew stranger, being transported And rapt in secret studies.	Since I was so drawn to studying things like logic, grammar, geometry, and astronomy, I let my control of the government slide a bit, being too wrapped up in my occult books.
Thy false uncle— Dost thou attend me?	Your disloyal uncle—are you paying attention?
Sir, most heedfully.	I’m hanging on every word.
O, good sir, I do.	Oh, yes I am, father.

The best news is that we have safely found Our king and company.	The best news of all is that we’ve located our king and our men.
The next, our ship— Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split— Is tight and yare and bravely rigged as when We first put out to sea.	The next bit of good news is that our ship—which we gave up for ruined only three hours ago—is as well-outfitted and seaworthy as it was when we first set sail.
These are not natural events.	These are unnatural events.
On a trice, so please you, Even in a dream were we divided from them And were brought moping hither.	In an instant we were separated from them, as if in a dream, and brought here in a daze.

Let me not, Since I have my dukedom got And pardoned the deceiver, dwell In this bare island by your spell, But release me from my bands With the help of your good hands.	Release me So I can return to my dukedom With your help.
As you from crimes would pardoned be, Let your indulgence set me free.	Just as you’d like to have your sins forgiven, Indulge me, forgive me, and set me free.
I pray thee, mark me.	Please listen to me carefully.
I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated To closeness and the bettering of my mind With that which, but by being so retired, O'erprized all popular rate, in my false brother Awaked an evil nature.	As I neglected practical matters, being totally dedicated to solitude and to improving my mind with subjects more valuable than most people imagine, I was so shut away from the world that I unwittingly stirred up evil wishes in my disloyal brother.
And my trust, Like a good parent, did beget of him A falsehood in its contrary as great As my trust was, which had indeed no limit, A confidence sans bound.	My deep trust in him made him deeply untrustworthy, arousing in him a treachery as big as my trust was—my trust which had no limit, an infinite confidence.

I should sin To think but nobly of my grandmother.	It would be wrong for me to think poorly of my grandmother.
The King of Naples, being an enemy To me inveterate, hearkens my brother’s suit, Which was that he, in lieu o' th' premises Of homage and I know not how much tribute, Should presently extirpate me and mine Out of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan With all the honors on my brother.	The king of Naples, my arch-enemy, listens to my brother’s request, which was that the king, in exchange for the respect and money paid to him, would get rid of me and make my brother Duke of Milan instead.
Alack, for pity!	How awful!
I, not remembering how I cried out then, Will cry it o'er again.	I can’t remember how I cried then, but I’ll cry all over again.
It is a hint That wrings mine eyes to ’t.	This story breaks my heart.
Hear a little further And then I’ll bring thee to the present business Which now ’s upon ’s, without the which this story Were most impertinent.	Just listen a little more, and I’ll bring you up to date about the present situation, which is the whole reason I’m telling you this story in the first place.
Wherefore did they not That hour destroy us?	Why didn’t they just kill us that night?
Well demanded, wench.	Good question, my girl.
My tale provokes that question.	My story does raise that question.
Dear, they durst not, So dear the love my people bore me, nor set A mark so bloody on the business, but With colors fairer painted their foul ends.	The answer, my dear, is that they didn’t dare, because the people of Milan loved me too much.
Alack, what trouble Was I then to you!	God, what a burden on you I must have been!
Oh, a cherubim Thou wast that did preserve me.	No, my dear, you were a little angel who kept me going.
Thou didst smile Infusèd with a fortitude from heaven, When I have decked the sea with drops full salt, Under my burthen groaned; which raised in me An undergoing stomach to bear up Against what should ensue.	You smiled with a strength you must have gotten from heaven, while I cried salty tears into the salty sea, and groaned at our situation.
How came we ashore?	How did we manage to get ashore?
By providence divine.	With God’s help.
Some food we had and some fresh water that A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo, Out of his charity, who being then appointed Master of this design, did give us, with Rich garments, linens, stuffs, and necessaries, Which since have steaded much.	We had a little food and fresh water that a nobleman from Naples, Gonzalo, had given us out of the kindness of his heart.
So, of his gentleness, Knowing I loved my books, he furnished me From mine own library with volumes that I prize above my dukedom.	Knowing how much I loved my books, he gave me some books from my library that I value more than my dukedom.
Would I might But ever see that man!	I wish I could see that man someday!
Now I arise.	Now I’ll stand up.
Heavens thank you for ’t!	May God thank you for it.
And now, I pray you, sir— For still ’tis beating in my mind—your reason For raising this sea storm?	But please, father—the question is still nagging at me—why did you conjure up this storm?

Approach, my Ariel, come.	Come here, Ariel.
All hail, great master!	Humble greetings, great master!
Grave sir, hail!	Worthy sir, greetings!
Hast thou, spirit, Performed to point the tempest that I bade thee?	Spirit, did you carry out the storm just as I ordered?
Sometime I’d divide, And burn in many places.	Sometimes I appeared in many places at once.
Jove’s lightning, the precursors O' th' dreadful thunderclaps, more momentary And sight-outrunning were not.	I flashed about faster than lightning.
My brave spirit!	Good spirit!
Boatswain!	Boatswain!
Here, master.	I’m here, sir.
What cheer?	Hurry, hurry!
Good, speak to th' mariners.	Come on, men!
Fall to ’t yarely, or we run ourselves aground.	That’s the way to do it!
Where’s the Master?	Where’s the Master?
Play the men.	Make these men work.
I pray now, keep below.	Please stay below deck, sir.
Where is the Master, Boatswain?	Where’s the Master, Boatswain?
Not a soul But felt a fever of the mad and played Some tricks of desperation.	Everyone there got a little crazy and pulled some desperate stunts.
All but mariners Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel, Then all afire with me.	Everyone except the sailors dove into the sea, leaving behind the ship that I had set on fire.
The king’s son, Ferdinand, With hair up-staring—then, like reeds, not hair— Was the first man that leaped, cried, “Hell is empty And all the devils are here.”      Why, that’s my spirit!	The king’s son, Ferdinand, with his hair standing straight up—it looked like reeds, not hair—was the first person to jump, shouting, “Hell is empty, and all the devils are here!” Good job!
But was not this nigh shore?	But was this near the shore?
Close by, my master.	Very near, my master.
But are they, Ariel, safe?	But are they all safe, Ariel?
Not a hair perished.	Nobody was hurt in the slightest.
On their sustaining garments not a blemish, But fresher than before.	Even their clothes are unstained, and look fresher than before the storm.
And, as thou badest me, In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.	I’ve separated them into groups around the island, just as you ordered.
The king’s son have I landed by himself, Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs In an odd angle of the isle, and sitting, His arms in this sad knot.	I sent the king’s son off by himself to a faraway nook on the island, where he’s sitting now sighing, with his arms crossed like this.
Of the king’s ship, The mariners, say how thou hast disposed, And all the rest o' th' fleet.	Tell me what you did with the king’s ship, the sailors, and the other ships.
The mariners all under hatches stowed, Who, with a charm joined to their suffered labor, I have left asleep.	The sailors are all below deck, sleeping both from their labor and from a magic spell I cast over them.
And for the rest o' th' fleet, Which I dispersed, they all have met again And are upon the Mediterranean float, Bound sadly home for Naples, Supposing that they saw the king’s ship wracked And his great person perish.	As for the rest of the ships, I scattered them, and they’ve gathered again in the Mediterranean, sailing sadly home to Naples, believing that they witnessed the shipwreck and death of their great king.
Ariel, thy charge Exactly is performed.	Ariel, you’ve done your work exactly as I ordered.
But there’s more work.	But there’s more work to be done.
What is the time o' th' day?	What time is it?
Past the mid season.	Past noon.
At least two glasses.	At least two hours past.
The time ’twixt six and now Must by us both be spent most preciously.	We can’t waste time between now and six o'clock.
Is there more toil?	Is there more work to do?
Since thou dost give me pains, Let me remember thee what thou hast promised, Which is not yet performed me.	Since you’re giving me new assignments, let me remind you what you promised me but haven’t come through with yet.
How now?	What?
Moody?	You’re in a bad mood?
What is ’t thou canst demand?	What could you possibly ask for?
My liberty.	My freedom.
Before the time be out?	Before your sentence has been completed?
No more!	Don’t say anything else.
I prithee, Remember I have done thee worthy service, Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served Without or grudge or grumblings.	I beg you, remember the good work I’ve done for you, and how I’ve never lied to you, never made mistakes, and never grumbled in my work.
Thou didst promise To bate me a full year.	You promised to take a full year off my sentence.
Dost thou forget From what a torment I did free thee?	Have you forgotten the torture I freed you from?
No.	No.
Thou dost, and think’st it much to tread the ooze Of the salt deep, To run upon the sharp wind of the north, To do me business in the veins o' th' earth When it is baked with frost.	You have forgotten, and you think it’s a burden when I ask you to walk through the ocean, or run on the north wind, or do business for me underground when the earth’s frozen solid.
I do not, sir.	No, I don’t, sir.
Thou liest, malignant thing!	You lie, you nasty, ungrateful thing!
Hast thou forgot The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy Was grown into a hoop?	Have you forgotten the horrid witch Sycorax, stooped over with old age and ill will?
Hast thou forgot her?	Have you forgotten her?
No, sir.	No, sir.
Thou hast.	You have.
Where was she born?	Where was she born?
Speak.	Speak.
Tell me.	Tell me.
Sir, in Argier.	In Algiers, sir.
Oh, was she so?	Oh, was she now?
I must Once in a month recount what thou hast been, Which thou forget’st.	I’ll have to tell the story again every month, since you seem to forget it.
This damned witch Sycorax, For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible To enter human hearing, from Argier, Thou know’st, was banished.	This damned witch Sycorax was kicked out of Algiers for various witching crimes too terrible for humans to hear about.
For one thing she did They would not take her life.	But for one reason they refused to execute her.
Is not this true?	Isn’t that true?
Ay, sir.	Yes, sir.
This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child And here was left by th' sailors.	This sunken-eyed hag was brought here pregnant and left by the sailors.
Thou, my slave, As thou report’st thyself, wast then her servant.	You, my slave, were her servant at the time, as you admit yourself.
And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate To act her earthy and abhorred commands, Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee, By help of her more potent ministers And in her most unmitigable rage, Into a cloven pine, within which rift Imprisoned thou didst painfully remain A dozen years; within which space she died And left thee there, where thou didst vent thy groans As fast as mill wheels strike.	In a fit of rage she locked you up in a hollow pine tree, with the help of her powerful assistants, and left you there for twelve years.
Dull thing, I say so.	That’s right, you stupid thing.
He, that Caliban Whom now I keep in service.	Caliban, who now serves me.
It was mine art, When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape The pine and let thee out.	It was my magic that saved you when I arrived on the island and heard you, making the pine tree open and let you out.
I thank thee, master.	Thank you, master.
If thou more murmur’st, I will rend an oak And peg thee in his knotty entrails till Thou hast howled away twelve winters.	If you complain any more, I’ll split an oak tree and lock you up in it till you’ve howled for twelve years.
Pardon, master.	Please forgive me, master.
I will be correspondent to command And do my spiriting gently.	I’ll be obedient and do all my tasks without complaining.
Do so, and after two days I will discharge thee.	Do that, and I’ll set you free in two days.
That’s my noble master!	That’s noble of you, master.
What shall I do?	What shall I do for you?
Say, what?	Just tell me.
What shall I do?	What shall I do?
Go make thyself like a nymph o' th' sea.	Go disguise yourself as a sea nymph.
Be subject To no sight but thine and mine, invisible To every eyeball else.	Be invisible to everyone except yourself and me.
Go take this shape And hither come in ’t.	Take this garment, put it on, and then come back here.
Go hence with diligence.	Hurry, go!
Shake it off.	Shake off your sleepiness.
Come on.	Come on.
We’ll visit Caliban, my slave who never Yields us kind answer.	We’ll go visit Caliban, my slave who always talks to us so nastily.
But as ’tis, We cannot miss him.	But even so, we can’t do without him.
He does make our fire, Fetch in our wood, and serves in offices That profit us.—What, ho!	He builds our fires, gets our firewood, and does all kinds of useful things for us.—Hey!
Slave!	Caliban!
Caliban!	Pile of dirt!
Speak.	Say something.
Come forth, I say!	Come out, I order you.
There’s other business for thee.	There’s other work for you to do.
Come, thou tortoise!	Come on, you turtle!
Fine apparition!	What a fine sight!
My quaint Ariel, Hark in thine ear.	My dear clever Ariel, listen carefully.
My lord it shall be done.	My lord, I’ll do it right away.
As wicked dew as e'er my mother brushed With raven’s feather from unwholesome fen Drop on you both!	I hope you both get drenched with a dew as evil as what my mother used to collect with a crow’s feather from the poison swamps.
A southwest blow on ye And blister you all o'er!	May a hot southwest wind blow on you and cover you with blisters all over.
For this, be sure, tonight thou shalt have cramps, Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up.	I’ll give you cramps for saying that—horrible pains in your sides that will keep you from breathing.
Urchins Shall, forth at vast of night that they may work, All exercise on thee.	I’ll send goblins out at night to work their nasty deeds on you.
Thou shalt be pinched As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging Than bees that made 'em.	You’ll be pricked all over, and it’ll sting like bees.
I must eat my dinner.	I have to eat my dinner now.
This island’s mine, by Sycorax my mother, Which thou takest from me.	This island belongs to me because Sycorax, my mother, left it to me.
Cursed be I that did so!	I curse myself for doing that!
Thou most lying slave, Whom stripes may move, not kindness!	You liar, you respond better to the whip than to kindness!
I have used thee, Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodged thee In mine own cell till thou didst seek to violate The honor of my child.	I took good care of you—piece of filth that you are—and let you stay in my own hut until you tried to rape my daughter.
Oh ho, oh ho!	Oh ho, oh ho!
Would ’t had been done!	I wish I had!
Thou didst prevent me.	You stopped me.
Abhorrèd slave, Which any print of goodness wilt not take, Being capable of all ill!	You horrid slave, you can’t be trained to be good, and you’re capable of anything evil!
I pitied thee, Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour One thing or other.	I pitied you, worked hard to teach you to speak, and taught you some new thing practically every hour.
But thy vile race, Though thou didst learn, had that in ’t which good natures Could not abide to be with.	But you had bad blood in you, no matter how much you learned, and good people couldn’t stand to be near you.
Therefore wast thou Deservedly confined into this rock, Who hadst deserved more than a prison.	So you got what you deserved, and were locked up in this cave, which is more fitting for the likes of you than a prison would be.
You taught me language, and my profit on ’t Is I know how to curse.	You taught me language, and all I can do with it is curse.
The red plague rid you For learning me your language!	Damn you for teaching me your language!
No, pray thee.	No, please.
So, slave, hence!	Go then, slave.
The watchdogs bark.	The watchdogs bark.
Hark, hark!	Listen, listen!
I hear The strain of strutting chanticleer Cry “Cock-a-diddle-dow.” Where should this music be?	Where’s that music coming from?
I' th' air or th' earth?	From the earth, or the air?
It sounds no more, and sure, it waits upon Some god o' th' island.	It’s stopped now—it must be played for some local god of the island.
Sitting on a bank, Weeping again the king my father’s wrack, This music crept by me upon the waters, Allaying both their fury and my passion With its sweet air.	As I sat on the shore crying over my father’s shipwreck, I heard the music creep over the wild waves, calming their fury and soothing my own grief with its sweet melodies.
Thence I have followed it, Or it hath drawn me rather.	I followed it here, or I should say it dragged me here.
But ’tis gone.	But now it’s stopped.
No, it begins again.	No, there it is again.
Hark, now I hear them.	Listen, I hear them.
The ditty does remember my drowned father.	This song’s about my dead father.
I hear it now above me.	I hear it now overhead.
What is ’t?	What is it?
A spirit?	A spirit?
Lord, how it looks about!	Lord, it’s glancing every which way!
Believe me, sir, It carries a brave form.	How handsome it is.
But ’tis a spirit.	It must be a spirit.
No, wench!	No, girl!
It eats and sleeps and hath such senses As we have, such.	It eats and sleeps and has the same five senses we do.
He hath lost his fellows And strays about to find 'em.	He’s lost his comrades and is wandering around looking for them.
Do you not hear him?	He’s busy, can’t you hear him giving orders?
You mar our labor.	You’re getting in the way of our work.
Keep your cabins.	Stay in your cabins.
You do assist the storm.	You’re helping the storm, not us.
Nay, good, be patient.	Don’t get wound up, my good man.
Hence!	Now get out of here!
To cabin, silence!	Go to your cabins and be quiet!
Trouble us not.	Don’t bother us up here.
Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.	Just remember who you’ve got on board with you, good man.
None that I more love than myself.	Nobody I care about more than myself.
You are a councilor.	You’re a king’s advisor.
Use your authority.	Go ahead, use your authority.
If you cannot, give thanks you have lived so long and make yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of the hour, if it so hap.—Cheerly, good hearts!—Out of our way, I say.	If you can’t do it, be grateful you’ve lived this long and go wait to die in your cabin, if it comes to that.—Harder, men!—Now get out of our way, I’m telling you.
I have great comfort from this fellow.	I feel a lot better after talking to this guy.
I might call him A thing divine, for nothing natural I ever saw so noble.	I could imagine he’s divine, since I never saw anything so noble-looking on earth before.
No wonder, sir, But certainly a maid.	I’m not marvelous, sir, but I’m certainly a maiden.
My language!	She speaks my language!
Heavens, I am the best of them that speak this speech, Were I but where ’tis spoken.	My God, I’m the highest-ranking person who speaks this language—if only we were back where it’s spoken.
How?	What’s that?
The best?	The highest-ranking?
What wert thou if the King of Naples heard thee?	What would the King of Naples do if he heard you say that?
A single thing, as I am now, that wonders To hear thee speak of Naples.	He would just see me for what I am, a person amazed to hear you talking about Naples.
He does hear me, And that he does I weep.	He does hear me, and that makes me cry.
Myself am Naples, Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld The king my father wracked.	I myself am the King of Naples, since I saw with my own eyes—these eyes that haven’t been dry since—my father killed in a shipwreck.
Alack, for mercy!	Ah, how pitiful!
Yes, faith, and all his lords, the Duke of Milan And his brave son being twain.	Yes, indeed, and all the King’s men, the Duke of Milan and his fine son too.
Soft, sir!	Hang on, sir!
One word more.	Just a moment.
If the ill spirit have so fair a house, Good things will strive to dwell with ’t.	If the devil had such a beautiful house as his body, then good things would fight to live in it.
What, I say?	What’s that?
Come from thy ward, For I can here disarm thee with this stick And make thy weapon drop.	Get out of that position, because I can disarm you with my magic wand and make your sword drop.
Beseech you, father.	Please, father, I beg you.
Hence!	Let go of me!
Hang not on my garments.	Don’t tug on my clothes.
Sir, have pity, I’ll be his surety.	Father, take pity on him.
Silence!	Quiet!
One word more Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee.	If you say one more word, I’ll punish you, maybe even hate you.
What, An advocate for an imposter?	You’re defending an impostor?
Hush, Thou think’st there is no more such shapes as he, Having seen but him and Caliban.	You think he’s special, since you’ve only ever seen him and Caliban.
Foolish wench, To th' most of men this is a Caliban And they to him are angels.	Foolish girl, in the eyes of most people this man’s a Caliban, and compared to him, they’re angels.
My affections Are then most humble.	Then my love is humble.
I have no ambition To see a goodlier man.	I don’t feel any urge to see a more handsome man than this one.
So they are.	That’s true, they are.
My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.	My strength is all gone, as if in a dream.
My father’s loss, the weakness which I feel, The wrack of all my friends, nor this man’s threats, To whom I am subdued, are but light to me, Might I but through my prison once a day Behold this maid.	The death of my father, my physical weakness, the loss of all my friends, the threats of this man who’s taken me prisoner—all that would be easy for me to take, if only I could look through my prison windows once a day and see this girl.
Space enough Have I in such a prison.	A prison like that would give me enough liberty.
Prithee, peace.	Please say no more.
A dollar.	What a pain.
Dolor comes to him, indeed.	Pain, yes indeed.
You have spoken truer than you purposed.	You thought you were being funny, but you said the truth.
You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.	You’re taking it more seriously than I meant it.
Well, I have done.	Well, I’m nearly finished.
But yet—   Which, of he or Adrian, for a good wager, first begins to crow?	Which one will start yammering first, Gonzalo or Adrian?
The old cock.	The old guy.
The cockerel.	I pick the younger one.
Done.	You’re on.
The wager?	What’s the prize?
A laughter.	A good laugh.
A match!	It’s a deal!
Though this island seem to be desert—	Though this island may appear desolate—
It must needs be of subtle, tender, and delicate temperance.	The island must be mild, and have a temperate climate.
Temperance was a delicate wench.	I knew Temperance—she was a fine girl.
Ay, and a subtle, as he most learnedly delivered.	Yes, and she was mild too.
The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.	There’s always a breath of fresh air here.
Or as ’twere perfumed by a fen.	Stinking like a swamp.
Here is everything advantageous to life.	This island contains everything beneficial to life.
True.	True.
Save means to live.	Everything except something to live on.
Of that there’s none, or little.	There’s little or nothing of that.
How lush and lusty the grass looks!	Look how lush and healthy the grass is!
How green!	How green!
The ground indeed is tawny.	The ground is brown.
With an eye of green in ’t.	With a touch of green in it.
He misses not much.	He doesn’t miss a thing.
No, he doth but mistake the truth totally.	No, he just gets reality completely wrong.
But the rarity of it is—which is indeed almost beyond credit—  As many vouched rarities are.	But the really unbelievable thing is—and this is incredible— As most unbelievable things are.
That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and glosses, being rather new-dyed than stained with salt water.	That our clothes were drenched with sea water, but they came out looking brand-new.
Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report.	Or stuff what he says into their pockets.
Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of the king’s fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.	Seriously, I think our clothes are as fresh now as they were the day we put them on in Africa, when we attended the marriage of the king’s daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.
Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.	It was a lovely wedding, and we’re doing really well on our trip home.
Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to their queen.	Tunis has never had such a beautiful queen.
Widow Dido” said you?	Next thing you know, he’ll be saying “widower Aeneas.” “Widow Dido,” did you say?
You make me study of that.	I’m not sure about that.
She was of Carthage, not of Tunis.	Dido was from Carthage, not Tunis.
Carthage?	Carthage?
I assure you, Carthage.	I’m telling you, it was Carthage.
His word is more than the miraculous harp.	Gonzalo is a miracle-worker.
What impossible matter will he make easy next?	What miracle will he work next?
I think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it his son for an apple.	I think he’ll carry this island home in his pocket and give it to his son like an apple.
And sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring forth more islands.	And then throw the seeds in the sea, to make more islands grow.
Ay.	Yes indeed.
Why, in good time.	Absolutely, yes indeed.
Down with the topmast!	Bring down that top sail!
Yare, lower, lower!	Fast!
Bring her to try wi' th' main course.	Let the ship sail close to the wind.
A plague upon this howling!	Damn those men shouting down there!
They are louder than the weather or our office.	They’re louder than the storm or us sailors.
Yet again?	Oh, not you again.
What do you here?	What do you want?
Shall we give o'er and drown?	Should we all give up and drown?
Have you a mind to sink?	Do you want to sink?
I’ll warrant him for drowning though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an unstanched wench.	Yes, I guarantee he won’t drown—even if this ship were as fragile as an eggshell and as leaky as a menstruating woman.
Lay her a-hold, a-hold!	Turn the ship to the wind!
All lost!	It’s no use!
To prayers, to prayers, all lost!	We’re done for!
And the rarest that e'er came there.	The most beautiful queen they ever had.
Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.	I beg your pardon, except for the widow Dido.
Oh, widow Dido?	Oh, except for the widow Dido?
Ay, widow Dido.	That’s right, except for the widow Dido.
Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I wore it?	Isn’t my vest just as clean and fresh as the day I put it on?
I mean, in a sort.	In a way, I mean.
That “sort” was well fished for.	In a way” is the right way to go.
When I wore it at your daughter’s marriage?	I mean when I wore it at your daughter’s wedding.
You cram these words into mine ears against The stomach of my sense.	You keep cramming words into my ears that I don’t want to hear.
Sir, he may live.	Sir, he may still be alive.
I not doubt He came alive to land.	I have no doubt he got ashore alive.
No, no, he’s gone.	No, no, he’s dead.
Prithee, peace.	Please be quiet.
You were kneeled to and importuned otherwise By all of us, and the fair soul herself Weighed between loathness and obedience, at Which end o' th' beam should bow.	We all begged you not to go ahead with those marriage plans, and your lovely daughter struggled between disgust at marrying an African and the desire to obey you.
We have lost your son, I fear, forever.	Now I’m afraid we’ve lost your son forever.
Milan and Naples have More widows in them of this business' making Than we bring men to comfort them.	Our shipwreck has made more women widows in Milan and Naples than there are survivors to comfort them.
The fault’s your own.	And it’s all your fault.
So is the dearest o' th' loss.	And the greatest sorrow is mine too.
My lord Sebastian, The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness And time to speak it in.	My lord Sebastian, even though what you say is true, your way of saying it is tactless and comes at the wrong time.
You rub the sore When you should bring the plaster.	You’re rubbing salt in his wounds when you should be applying bandages.
Very well.	All right, I’ll stop.
And most chirurgeonly.	Like a good doctor.
Foul weather?	Bad times?
Very foul.	Yes, very bad.
Had I plantation of this isle, my lord— He’d sow ’t with nettle seed.	If I could colonize this island, my lord— He’d cultivate weeds on it.
Or docks, or mallows.	Or thorn-bushes.
And were the king on ’t, what would I do?	And if I were king of it, you know what I’d do?
Scape being drunk for want of wine.	He wouldn’t get drunk much, since there’s no wine here.
For no kind of traffic Would I admit.	I wouldn’t allow any commerce.
No occupation.	There’d be no work.
No sovereignty—     Yet he would be king on ’t.	There’d be no kingship— He wants to be king in a place with no kingship.
All things in common nature should produce Without sweat or endeavor.	Everything would be produced without labor, and would be shared by all.
But nature should bring forth Of its own kind all foison, all abundance, To feed my innocent people.	Nature would produce its harvests in abundance, to feed my innocent people.
No marrying ’mong his subjects?	There’d be no marriage?
None, man.	No.
Prithee, no more.	Oh, please be quiet.
Thou dost talk nothing to me.	You’re absolutely right, your highness.
Twas you we laughed at.	It’s you we were laughing at.
What a blow was there given!	Ouch, what a comeback!
An it had not fallen flat-long.	Too bad it fell flat.
You are gentlemen of brave mettle.	You’re brave gentlemen.
You would lift the moon out of her sphere if she would continue in it five weeks without changing.	You’d give the moon a shove if it got stuck five weeks in its orbit.
We would so, and then go a-batfowling.	That’s right, and then after we fixed the moon, we’d go bird-hunting.
No, I warrant you.	I’m not.
Go sleep, and hear us.	Go to sleep, and listen to us laughing.
What, all so soon asleep?	What, everybody falls asleep so fast?
I wish mine eyes Would with themselves shut up my thoughts.	I wish I could sleep too—it would stop me from thinking.
Please you, sir, Do not omit the heavy offer of it.	Come to think of it, I am feeling sleepy.
It seldom visits sorrow.	In that case you should sleep.
We two, my lord, Will guard your person while you take your rest And watch your safety.	The two of us will guard you while you sleep, my lord, and keep you safe.
Thank you.	Thank you.
Wondrous heavy.	I’m terribly sleepy.
What a strange drowsiness possesses them!	How strange that they all got so sleepy!
It is the quality o' th' climate.	There must be something in the air here.
Why Doth it not then our eyelids sink?	So why aren’t our eyelids heavy?
I find not Myself disposed to sleep.	I’m not sleepy at all.
Nor I.	Me neither.
My spirits are nimble.	I’m wide awake.
They fell together all, as by consent.	They all fell asleep together, as if they’d planned it.
Th' occasion speaks thee, and My strong imagination sees a crown Dropping upon thy head.	Opportunity’s knocking for you, and in my imagination I see a crown dropping onto your head.
What, art thou waking?	Are you dreaming or awake?
Do you not hear me speak?	Don’t you hear me speaking?
I do, and surely It is a sleepy language, and thou speak’st Out of thy sleep.	I do, and it sounds like you’re talking in your sleep.
What is it thou didst say?	What did you say?
Thou dost snore distinctly.	You’re snoring, but it sounds like you’re talking.
There’s meaning in thy snores.	There’s meaning in your snoring.
I’ll teach you how to flow.	I’ll show you how.
Do so.	You need to.
Oh, If you but knew how you the purpose cherish Whiles thus you mock it!	Oh, if you only knew how close to success you are, even while you make fun of what I’m telling you!
How, in stripping it, You more invest it!	The more you joke about it, the more clearly I feel how serious it is!
Ebbing men indeed Most often do so near the bottom run By their own fear or sloth.	Lazy people end up at the bottom, and you deserve to be at the top.
Prithee, say on.	Please, tell me more.
I have no hope That he’s undrowned.	Yes, I’m sure he’s dead.
Oh, out of that “no hope” What great hope have you!	I’ve got no hope that he survived.
No hope that way is Another way so high a hope that even Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond, But doubt discovery there.	But in that “no hope” there are great hopes for you!
Will you grant with me That Ferdinand is drowned?	Do you agree that Ferdinand must have drowned?
He’s gone.	He’s dead.
Then, tell me, Who’s the next heir of Naples?	So, in that case, tell me who’s next in line to inherit the kingdom of Naples?
Claribel.	Claribel, his daughter.
Tis true, my brother’s daughter’s Queen of Tunis, So is she heir of Naples, ’twixt which regions There is some space.	It’s true that my brother’s daughter is Queen of Tunis, and heir of Naples.
I myself could make A chough of as deep chat.	I could do it myself.
Oh, that you bore The mind that I do, what a sleep were this For your advancement!	Do you even get what I’m saying?
Methinks I do.	I think I do.
And how does your content Tender your own good fortune?	And does this prospect of good fortune make you happy?
I remember You did supplant your brother Prospero.	I remember you took the throne from your brother Prospero.
My brother’s servants Were then my fellows.	My brother’s servants used to be my equals.
Now they are my men.	Now they work for me.
But, for your conscience?	But what about your guilty conscience?
Ay, sir.	Yes.
But I feel not This deity in my bosom.	I don’t feel anything.
Should not upbraid our course.	As
For all the rest, They’ll take suggestion as a cat laps milk.	for the other men, we can make them believe anything we choose.
They’ll tell the clock to any business that We say befits the hour.	They’ll set their watches to whatever time we say.
Thy case, dear friend, Shall be my precedent.	You’ll be my role model.
As thou got’st Milan, I’ll come by Naples.	Just as you got Milan, I’ll get Naples.
Draw thy sword.	Take out your sword.
One stroke Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest.	With one cut you can be through paying money to Naples.
And I the king shall love thee.	And as king I’ll love you forever.
Draw together.	You take out your sword too.
And when I rear my hand, do you the like, To fall it on Gonzalo.	When I raise my hand, you do the same, and bring it down on Gonzalo’s head.
O, but one word.	Oh, but there’s one more thing to tell you.
What, must our mouths be cold?	What, we’re going to die?
The king and prince at prayers.	The king and the prince are praying.
I’m out of patience.	I’m out of patience.
He’ll be hanged yet, though every drop of water swear against it and gape at widest to glut him.	This bigmouth jerk here—( He’ll still die by hanging, not drowning, even if every drop of water in the sea tries to swallow him.
Let’s all sink wi' th' king.	Let’s all sink with the king.
Let’s take leave of him.	Let’s say goodbye to him.
Then let us both be sudden.	Let’s act quickly.
Why are you drawn?	Why are your swords out?
Wherefore this ghastly looking?	Why do you look like that?
What’s the matter?	What’s this all about?
Whiles we stood here securing your repose, Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing Like bulls, or rather lions.	While we were here guarding you as you slept, we heard a loud roar that sounded like bulls, or lions.
Did ’t not wake you?	Didn’t you hear it?
It struck mine ear most terribly.	We heard it very clearly.
I heard nothing.	I didn’t hear anything.
Oh, ’twas a din to fright a monster’s ear, To make an earthquake!	Oh, it was a monstrous roar, to make the earth tremble!
Sure, it was the roar Of a whole herd of lions.	I’m sure there was a herd of lions nearby.
Heard you this, Gonzalo?	Did you hear this, Gonzalo?
Upon mine honor, sir, I heard a humming, And that a strange one too, which did awake me.	It’s true I heard a humming sound, a strange one, which woke me up.
I shaked you, sir, and cried.	I shook you and shouted at you, sir.
As mine eyes opened, I saw their weapons drawn.	When I opened my eyes, I saw their swords out.
There was a noise, That’s verily.	There was a noise, that’s certainly true.
Let’s draw our weapons.	Let’s draw our own swords too.
Heavens keep him from these beasts!	I hope those lions stay far away from him.

And so adieu, good madam.	So goodbye, my lady.
No, faith, I’ll not stay a jot longer.	No, I won’t stay a second longer.
Thy reason, dear venom, give thy reason.	Why are you leaving, my angry friend?
You must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew.	Yes, you have to tell us why, Sir Andrew.
Marry, I saw your niece do more favors to the Count’s servingman than ever she bestowed upon me.	Well, because I saw your niece Olivia treat the count’s messenger better than she’s ever treated me.
I saw ’t i' the orchard.	I saw it in the orchard.
Did she see thee the while, old boy?	Did she see you there the whole time, old boy?
Tell me that.	Tell me that.
As plain as I see you now.	Yes, she saw me quite clearly.
This was a great argument of love in her toward you.	Well, that proves she’s in love with you.
Slight, will you make an ass o' me?	Are you trying to make fun of me?
I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of judgment and reason.	No, I’ll prove it with airtight evidence and logical argument.
And they have been grand-jurymen since before Noah was a sailor.	And you can’t deny evidence and argument—They’ve been around since Noah’s ark.
She did show favor to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valor, to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver.	She flirted with the messenger boy to exasperate you, fire up your passions, and make you angry and jealous.
You should then have accosted her, and with some excellent jests, fire-new from the mint, you should have banged the youth into dumbness.	You should have run up to her, unleashed a few excellent quips invented on the spot, and rendered the young man speechless.
This was looked for at your hand, and this was balked.	That’s what she was expecting, and you let her down.
An ’t be any way, it must be with valor, for policy I hate.	I’ll have to do something courageous then, because I hate intrigue.
I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician.	I’d rather be a heretic than a schemer with fancy plots.
Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valor.	Well then, improve your situation with a show of courage.
Challenge me the count’s youth to fight with him.	Challenge the count’s young servant to a fight.
Hurt him in eleven places.	Hurt him in eleven different places.
My niece shall take note of it, and assure thyself, there is no love-broker in the world can more prevail in man’s commendation with woman than report of valor.	My niece Olivia will notice, and let me tell you, no matchmaker in the world can get you a woman faster than a reputation for courage.
There is no way but this, Sir Andrew.	It’s really the only way, Sir Andrew.
Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?	Will either of you give him the message that I’m challenging him to a duel?
Go, write it in a martial hand.	Go ahead and write it down.
Be curst and brief.	Be pointed and brief.
It is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent and full of invention.	It doesn’t need to be witty as long as it’s eloquent and imaginative.
Go.	Go on.
This is a dear manikin to you, Sir Toby.	This precious little guy is putty in your hands, Sir Toby.
I have been dear to him, lad, some two thousand strong, or so.	His letter’s going to be hilarious.
We shall have a rare letter from him: but you’ll not deliver ’t?	But you’re not going to deliver it, are you?
Never trust me, then.	Never trust me again if I don’t.
And by all means stir on the youth to an answer.	And by all means see if you can get the young man to answer it.
I think oxen and wainropes cannot hale them together.	I don’t think a team of oxen could get them close enough to fight.
Look where the youngest wren of nine comes.	Here comes my little bird.
If you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourself into stitches, follow me.	Listen, if you want a good laugh—and I mean a side-splitting one—then follow me.
He’s in yellow stockings.	He’s wearing yellow stockings.
And cross-gartered?	With crisscrossed laces?
Most villanously, like a pedant that keeps a school i' the church.	Oh, he looks like a pathetic Sunday school teacher.
He does smile his face into more lines than is in the new map with the augmentation of the Indies.	He smiles so much his face has more lines in it than a map of the East Indies.
You have not seen such a thing as ’tis.	You’ve never seen anything like it.
I can hardly forbear hurling things at him.	I can hardly keep myself from throwing things at him.
I know my lady will strike him.	I know that my lady’s going to end up hitting him.
If she do, he’ll smile and take ’t for a great favor.	And when she does, he’ll imagine she’s flirting with him.
Come, bring us, bring us where he is.	Come on, take us to him.
I could not stay behind you.	I couldn’t stay behind after you left.
My kind Antonio, I can no other answer make but thanks, And thanks, and ever thanks.	My friend Antonio, all I can say is thank you.
What’s to do?	Anyway, what should we do?
Shall we go see the relics of this town?	Should we go see the sights in the town?
Belike you slew great number of his people?	You probably killed a lot of his men?
It might have since been answered in repaying What we took from them, which, for traffic’s sake, Most of our city did.	The whole quarrel might have been resolved since then when we repaid what we stole from them—which most of our city did, for the sake of friendly trade relations.
Only myself stood out; For which, if I be lapsèd in this place, I shall pay dear.	I was the only one who refused to give back what I stole.
Do not then walk too open.	Then don’t make yourself too conspicuous.
It doth not fit me.	You’re right.
Hold, sir, here’s my purse.	Hang on a minute, here’s some money for you.
Haply your eye shall light upon some toy You have desire to purchase, and your store, I think, is not for idle markets, sir.	Maybe you’ll see some little trinket you want to buy.
I’ll be your purse-bearer and leave you For an hour.	I’ll hold on to your money and leave you for an hour.
To the Elephant.	We’ll meet at the Elephant.
I do remember.	I remember.
I have sent after him.	I’ve sent for him.
He says he’ll come.	He says he’ll come.
For youth is bought more oft than begged or borrow’d.	It’s easier to buy young people than to beg or borrow them.
I speak too loud.— Where’s Malvolio?	Oh, I’m talking too loud.—Where’s Malvolio?
He is sad and civil And suits well for a servant with my fortunes.	He’s very serious, which is right for someone in mourning like me.
Where is Malvolio?	Where is Malvolio?
He’s coming, madam; but in very strange manner.	He’s coming, madam; but he’s acting very strangely.
He is sure possessed, madam.	He must be possessed by the devil.
Why, what’s the matter?	Why, what’s the matter with him?
Does he rave?	Is he talking nonsense?
No, madam, he does nothing but smile.	No, he just smiles.
Your ladyship were best to have some guard about you if he come, for sure the man is tainted in ’s wits.	You should have a guard nearby if he comes in here, because he’s clearly disturbed.
Go call him hither.	Ask him in here.
I am as mad as he, If sad and merry madness equal be.	I’m as crazy as he is, if sad craziness and happy craziness are equivalent.
How now, Malvolio?	What’s going on, Malvolio?
Sweet lady, ho, ho.	Hello, sweet lady.
Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.	Why, he has an income of three thousand ducats a year.
He’s a very fool and a prodigal.	He’s a fool and a spendthrift.
Fie, that you’ll say so!	You shouldn’t talk about him like that!
By this hand, they are scoundrels and substractors that say so of him.	Anyone who says that is a lying piece of garbage.
Who are they?	Who said that?
They that add, moreover, he’s drunk nightly in your company.	The same people who say he gets drunk with you every night.
With drinking healths to my niece.	We only drink toasts to my niece.
I’ll drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat and drink in Illyria.	I’ll drink to her as long as there’s a hole in my throat and booze in Illyria.
He’s a coward and a coistrel that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o' th' toe like a parish top.	Anyone who refuses to drink to my niece until his brain spins around like a merry-go-round is scum.
Sir Toby Belch!	Sir Toby Belch!
How now, Sir Toby Belch!	How are you, Sir Toby Belch?
Sweet Sir Andrew!	Sweet Sir Andrew!
Smilest thou?	You’re smiling?
I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.	I sent for you about a sad occasion.
Sad, lady!	Sad, my lady!
I could be sad.	I could be sad if I wanted to be.
This does make some obstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering, but what of that?	These crisscrossing laces do cut off the circulation in my legs a bit, but who cares?
If it please the eye of one, it is with me as the very true sonnet is, “Please one, and please all.”  Why, how dost thou, man?	As the sonnet says, “If you please one special person, you please everyone who matters.” Why, what’s going on?
What is the matter with thee?	What’s the matter with you?
Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs.	My legs may be yellow, but I don’t feel blue.
It did come to his hands, and commands shall be executed.	It was addressed to him, and orders must be obeyed.
I think we do know the sweet Roman hand.	I think we know whose fancy handwriting that was.
Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?	Don’t you think you should go to bed, Malvolio?
To bed?	To bed!
How do you, Malvolio?	How are you feeling, Malvolio?
At your request!	You’re asking me!
Yes, nightingales answer daws!	Noble people don’t answer to peasants!
Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady?	Why are you acting so brazen toward my lady?
Be not afraid of greatness.” 'Twas well writ.	Don’t be afraid of greatness.” That was well written.
What meanest thou by that, Malvolio?	What do you mean by that, Malvolio?
Some are born great—”	Some are born great—”
Ha?	What?
Some achieve greatness—” What sayest thou?	Some achieve greatness—” What are you saying?
And some have greatness thrust upon them.” Heaven restore thee!	And some have greatness thrust upon them.” Heaven help you!
Remember who commended thy yellow stockings—” Thy yellow stockings?	Remember who liked your yellow stockings—” Your yellow stockings?
And wished to see thee cross-gartered.” Cross-gartered?	And wanted to see you with laces crisscrossed over your legs.” Crisscrossed?
Go to, thou art made, if thou desirest to be so—” Am I made?	Go ahead.
Madam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsino’s is returned.	Madam, Count Orsino’s young messenger has returned.
I’ll come to him.	I’ll go to him.
Good Maria, let this fellow be looked to.	Maria, take care of this poor fellow here.
Where’s my cousin Toby?	Where’s my cousin Toby?
Let some of my people have a special care of him.	Have some of my servants take care of Malvolio.
I would not have him miscarry for the half of my dowry.	I’d give half my dowry to keep anything bad from happening to him.
Oh, ho!	Oh ho!
Do you come near me now?	Look at me now!
This concurs directly with the letter.	This is just what the letter said.
Cast thy humble slough,” says she.	Get rid of your low-class trapping,” she said.
I have limed her, but it is Jove’s doing, and Jove make me thankful!	I’ve got her now, but I’ve got God to thank for it!
And when she went away now, “Let this fellow be looked to.” “Fellow!” Not “Malvolio,” nor after my degree, but “fellow.” Why, everything adheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous or unsafe circumstance—what can be said?	And when she left just now, she said “Take care of this poor fellow here.” Fellow!” Not “Malvolio,” not anything referring to my low station in life, but “fellow.” Everything’s going perfectly.
Nothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my hopes.	Nothing can come between me and the fulfillment of all my hopes.
Well, Jove, not I, is the doer of this, and he is to be thanked.	Well, God is responsible for that, not me, and he deserves thanks.
If all the devils of hell be drawn in little, and Legion himself possessed him, yet I’ll speak to him.	I don’t care if all the devils in hell crammed together to possess him, I still want to speak to him.
Here he is, here he is.	Here he is, here he is.
How is’t with you, sir?	How are you, sir?
Go off, I discard you.	Go away.
Let me enjoy my private.	Let me enjoy my privacy.
Go off.	Go away.
Aha!	Ah-ha!
Does she so?	Does she?
Do you know what you say?	Do you even know what you’re talking about?
Marry, and it shall be done tomorrow morning if I live.	Sure thing, we’ll do it tomorrow morning.
My lady would not lose him for more than I’ll say.	My lady would never want to lose him.
How now, mistress?	What are you saying, mistress?
O Lord!	Oh, Lord!
No way but gentleness, gently, gently.	Gentleness is the only way to go—gently, gently.
The fiend is rough and will not be roughly used.	The devil inside him is rough, but we can’t treat it roughly.
Sir!	Sir!
Ay, Biddy, come with me.—What, man!	Yes, dear little chick, come along with me.—Shut up, man!
Tis not for gravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan.	You’re serious enough to know not to play games with Satan.
Hang him, foul collier!	Damn that dirty black coalminer of a devil!
Get him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby, get him to pray.	Get him to say his prayers, Sir Toby, get him to pray.
My prayers, minx?	My prayers, you hussy?
Go, hang yourselves all!	Go hang yourselves, all of you!
You are idle, shallow things.	You’re all lazy and shallow.
I am not of your element.	I’m not like you.
You shall know more hereafter.	You’ll know more about it later.
Is ’t possible?	Is it possible?
If this were played upon a stage now, I could condemn it as an improbable fiction.	If this were a play, I’d complain it was unrealistic.
His very genius hath taken the infection of the device, man.	He’s really taken this prank to heart.
Nay, pursue him now, lest the device take air and taint.	No, follow him now, before he divulges the prank and ruins everything.
Why, we shall make him mad indeed.	Wow, we’re really going to drive him crazy.
The house will be the quieter.	The house will be so much quieter.
Come, we’ll have him in a dark room and bound.	Come on, let’s put him in a dark room and tie him up.
My niece is already in the belief that he’s mad.	My niece already thinks he’s insane.
More matter for a May morning.	Here’s more insanity for us.
Is ’t so saucy?	Is it that aggressive?
Ay, is ’t, I warrant him.	Yes, it is, I think.
Do but read.	Just read it.
Give me.	Give it to me.
A good note, that keeps you from the blow of the law.	That’s a good thing to put in—it keeps you from getting in trouble with the law.
Very brief, and to exceeding good sense—less.	Nice and short and full of good sense—or should I say nonsense?
Good.	Good.
Still you keep o' the windy side of the law.	You still haven’t said anything incriminating.
Good.	Good.
Andrew Aguecheek”	Andrew Aguecheek”
If this letter move him not, his legs cannot.	If this letter doesn’t make him fight, I don’t know what will.
I’ll give ’t him.	I’ll give it to him.
You may have very fit occasion for ’t.	You might have a great opportunity to give it to him right now.
He is now in some commerce with my lady and will by and by depart.	He’s conducting some business with my lady, and sooner or later he’ll leave.
Go, Sir Andrew.	Go, Sir Andrew.
Scout me for him at the corner the orchard like a bum-baily.	Look out for him in the corner of the orchard as if you were a sheriff’s deputy.
Away!	Now go!
Nay, let me alone for swearing.	Don’t worry about me not swearing enough.
His employment between his lord and my niece confirms no less.	The fact that he serves as a go-between for his lord and my niece Olivia confirms this.
Therefore this letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed no terror in the youth.	So this letter, which is so incredibly stupid and ignorant, isn’t going to scare him at all.
He will find it comes from a clodpole.	He’ll just think an idiot wrote it.
But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by word of mouth, set upon Aguecheek a notable report of valor, and drive the gentleman (as I know his youth will aptly receive it) into a most hideous opinion of his rage, skill, fury, and impetuosity.	But I’ll deliver Sir Andrew’s challenge by word of mouth, describing Sir Andrew as courageous in battle and convincing the young gentleman that Sir Andrew is furious, impetuous, and a skilled fighter (he’ll believe me because he’s young).
This will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the look, like cockatrices.	This will make them both so afraid that they’ll kill each other just by looking at each other.
Here he comes with your niece.	Here comes the messenger with your niece.
Give them way till he take leave, and presently after him.	Leave them alone until he sets off home, and then follow him.
I will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a challenge.	Meanwhile, I’ll think of some horrible way to phrase the challenge.
With the same 'havior that your passion bears Goes on my master’s grief.	My lord acts just as crazy with love as you do.
Here, wear this jewel for me.	Here, take this piece of jewelry.
Tis my picture.	There’s a picture of me inside.
Refuse it not.	Don’t refuse it.
It hath no tongue to vex you.	It won’t annoy you like me, because it doesn’t have a voice.
And I beseech you come again tomorrow.	And I beg you, please come here again tomorrow.
What shall you ask of me that I’ll deny, That honor, saved, may upon asking give?	What could you possibly ask of me that I wouldn’t give you, as long as it didn’t damage my honor and self-respect?
Nothing but this: your true love for my master.	Nothing, except your true love for my lord.
How with mine honor may I give him that Which I have given to you?	How could I honorably give him what I’ve already given you?
I will acquit you.	I’ll give it back to you.
Well, come again tomorrow.	Just come again tomorrow.
Fare thee well.	Good-bye.
A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.	A devil like you could lead me to hell.
Gentleman, God save thee.	Hello, sir.
And you, sir.	Hello to you.
That defense thou hast, betake thee to ’t.	You’d better think up a way to defend yourself.
Of what nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know not, but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody as the hunter, attends thee at the orchard end.	I don’t know what you’ve done to upset him, but someone has challenged you to a duel.
Dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, for thy assailant is quick, skillful and deadly.	Draw your sword and get on your toes, because your assailant is quick, skillful, and deadly.
You mistake, sir.	There must be some mistake, sir.
I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me.	I’m sure nobody would have any reason to fight with me.
My remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offense done to any man.	I can’t remember anything I’ve ever done to offend anyone.
You’ll find it otherwise, I assure you.	You’re wrong about that, I assure you.
I pray you, sir, what is he?	But who is this person, sir?
He is knight, dubbed with unhatched rapier and on carpet consideration, but he is a devil in private brawl.	He’s a knight.
Souls and bodies hath he divorced three, and his incensement at this moment is so implacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulchre.	He’s killed three people, and he’s so furious right now that the only thing that will satisfy him is seeing you die.
Hob, nob, is his word.	Fight to the death” is his motto.
And you too, sir.	Hello, sir.
Accost, Sir Andrew, accost.	Chat her up, Sir Andrew.
What’s that?	What?
Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.	My dear Miss Chat-her-up, I look forward to getting to know you better.
My name is Mary, sir.	My name is Mary, sir.
By my troth, I would not undertake her in this company.	I was telling you to go after her, woo her, confront her.
Is that the meaning of “accost”?	Is that really what you meant?
An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst never draw sword again.	If you let her go this easily, Sir Andrew, you don’t deserve to ever use your sword again.
An you part so, mistress, I would I might never draw sword again.	If you leave like this, my dear, I won’t ever use my sword again.
Fair lady, do you think you have fools in hand?	Do you think you’ve got a couple of fools on your hands here?
Sir, I have not you by the hand.	I’m not holding your hand, sir.
I will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady.	I’ll go back inside and ask the lady for some kind of escort.
I am no fighter.	I’m not a fighter.
I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others, to taste their valor.	I’ve heard of men who pick fights with other people on purpose, just to see how brave they are.
Belike this is a man of that quirk.	This man is probably like that.
Sir, no.	No, sir.
His indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury.	He’s furious because you insulted him, and he has a right to satisfaction.
Therefore get you on and give him his desire.	So go out there and give him what he wants.
Back you shall not to the house, unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety you might answer him.	You can’t go back into the house unless you want to fight with me—and if you’re willing to do that, you might as well just go and fight with him.
This is as uncivil as strange.	This is as rude as it is strange.
I beseech you, do me this courteous office, as to know of the knight what my offense to him is.	Please, do me this one favor: find out what I’ve done to offend this knight.
It is something of my negligence, nothing of my purpose.	It must be something I did accidentally.
I will do so.	I will do so.
Signior Fabian, stay you by this gentleman till my return.	Mr. Fabian, stay with this gentleman until I come back.
Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?	Excuse me, sir, do you know anything about this?
I beseech you, what manner of man is he?	What kind of man is he?
He is, indeed, sir, the most skillful, bloody, and fatal opposite that you could possibly have found in any part of Illyria.	He really is the most skillful, bloodthirsty, and dangerous opponent you can find in Illyria.
Will you walk towards him?	Do you want to go see him?
I will make your peace with him if I can.	I’ll try to calm him down for you if I can.
I shall be much bound to you for ’t.	I’d be very grateful to you if you did.
Why, man, he’s a very devil.	Wow, he’s a real devil.
I have not seen such a firago.	I’ve never seen such a monster.
I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard, and all, and he gives me the stuck-in with such a mortal motion, that it is inevitable.	I had a round with him, and his sword thrust is so deadly that you can’t even duck out of the way.
And on the answer, he pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they step on.	And when he strikes back at you, he’ll hit you as sure as you’re standing there.
They say he has been fencer to the Sophy.	They say he used to fence for the shah of Persia.
Pox on ’t!	That’s it!
I’ll not meddle with him.	I won’t mess with him.
Ay, but he will not now be pacified.	Yes, but now there’s no way to calm him down.
Fabian can scarce hold him yonder.	Fabian can hardly control him over there.
Plague on ’t, an I thought he had been valiant and so cunning in fence, I’d have seen him damned ere I’d have challenged him.	Darn it, if I’d guessed he was so brave and such a good swordsman, I never would have challenged him.
Let him let the matter slip, and I’ll give him my horse, gray Capilet.	I’ll give him my gray horse Capilet if he forgets the whole thing.
I’ll make the motion.	I’ll give it a try.
Stand here, make a good show on ’t.	Stay right here and try to look good.
This shall end without the perdition of souls.	This may end without anyone getting killed.
I’ll ride your horse as well as I ride you.	He’s just as terrified of Sir Andrew.
He is as horribly conceited of him, and pants and looks pale, as if a bear were at his heels.	He’s pale and hyperventilating, as if a bear were chasing him.
Come, Sir Andrew, there’s no remedy.	Come on, Sir Andrew, there’s nothing you can do about it.
The gentleman will, for his honor’s sake, have one bout with you.	The gentleman insists on fighting a round with you, for the sake of his honor.
He cannot by the duello avoid it.	The rules of dueling say he has to.
But he has promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, he will not hurt you.	But as a gentleman and a soldier he’s promised me he won’t hurt you.
Come on, to ’t.	Come on, get ready.
Pray God, he keep his oath!	I hope to God he keeps his promise!
I do assure you, ’tis against my will.	I swear to you, I don’t want to be doing this.
Put up your sword.	Put your sword away.
If this young gentleman Have done offence, I take the fault on me.	If this young gentleman has offended you, I’ll take the blame for it.
If you offend him, I for him defy you.	If you’ve offended him, I’ll fight you.
You, sir?	You, sir?
Why, what are you?	Who are you?
One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more Than you have heard him brag to you he will.	In fact, I’d do even more to him than what you’ve heard him promise to do.
Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you.	If you’re someone who gets into fights, I’ll fight with you.
O good Sir Toby, hold!	Oh, Sir Toby, stop!
Here come the officers.	The police are here.
Marry, will I, sir.	I certainly will, sir.
And for that I promised you, I’ll be as good as my word.	And as for what I promised to you, I’m as good as my word.
He will bear you easily and reins well.	You can ride him easily, and he responds well when you pull the reins.
This is the man.	This is the man.
Do thy office.	Do your job.
Antonio, I arrest thee at the suit of Count Orsino.	Antonio, you’re under arrest on the orders of Count Orsino.
You do mistake me, sir.	You must be mistaking me for someone else, sir.
No, sir, no jot.	No, sir, not at all.
I know your favor well, Though now you have no sea-cap on your head.— Take him away.	I recognize your face perfectly, even without a sailor’s cap on your head.—Take him away.
He knows I know him well.	He knows I recognize him.
I must obey.	I have to obey.
You stand amazed, But be of comfort.	Don’t worry about me.
Come, sir, away.	Come on, sir, let’s go.
What money, sir?	What money, sir?
I’ll make division of my present with you.	Take this.
Hold, there’s half my coffer.	It’s half of all my money.
Will you deny me now?	Are you really going to pretend you don’t know me now?
I hate ingratitude more in a man Than lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness, Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption Inhabits our frail blood—    O heavens themselves!	I hate an ungrateful man more than I hate lying, vanity, babbling, drunkenness, or any other vice that we feeble human beings are susceptible to.— Oh, my God!
Come, sir, I pray you, go.	Come on, sir, please.
Let me speak a little.	Let’s go.
Away!	Let’s go!
But oh, how vile an idol proves this god!	But oh, what a deceiver he turned out to be!
None can be called deformed but the unkind.	Only really cruel people can be called deformed.
Virtue is beauty, but the beauteous evil Are empty trunks o'erflourished by the devil.	Virtue is beauty, but someone beautiful and wicked is like an empty box decorated by the devil.
The man grows mad.	The man’s going crazy.
Away with him.	Take him away.
Lead me on.	Take me.
Methinks his words do from such passion fly, That he believes himself.	I don’t believe it.
So do not I.	Yet I wish I could.
Prove true, imagination, oh, prove true, That I, dear brother, be now ta'en for you!	Oh, please be true, please let it be that this man has mistaken me for you, my dear brother!
Come hither, knight.	Come here, Sir Andrew.
Come hither, Fabian.	You too, Fabian.
We’ll whisper o'er a couplet or two of most sage saws.	We’ve got some words of wisdom to mull over.

A very dishonest paltry boy, and more a coward than a hare.	He’s a very dishonest, puny boy, and more cowardly than a rabbit.
His dishonesty appears in leaving his friend here in necessity and denying him.	He abandoned his friend here in an emergency, and even pretended he didn’t know him.
And for his cowardship, ask Fabian.	As for his cowardliness, ask Fabian.
A coward, a most devout coward, religious in it.	He’s a coward, a total coward.

Let me be clear of thee.	Leave me alone.
Well held out, i' faith.	Good for you, holding out on me like this!
No, I do not know you, nor I am not sent to you by my lady, to bid you come speak with her, nor your name is not Master Cesario, nor this is not my nose neither.	No, I don’t know you, and my lady didn’t send me to get you, and I’m not supposed to tell you to come speak with her, and your name is not Master Cesario, and this is not my nose, either.
Nothing that is so is so.	Nothing is what it is.
I prithee, vent thy folly somewhere else.	Oh please, go somewhere else to blab your nonsense.
Thou know’st not me.	You don’t know me.
Vent my folly?	Blab my nonsense?
He has heard that word of some great man and now applies it to a fool.	He must’ve heard that phrase describing some great man and now he’s using it on a jester.
Vent my folly!	Blab my nonsense!
I am afraid this great lubber, the world, will prove a cockney.	What an idiotic place this world is.
I prithee now, ungird thy strangeness and tell me what I shall vent to my lady.	Now please stop being so strange and tell me what exactly I should blab to my lady.
Shall I vent to her that thou art coming?	Should I blab to her that you’re coming?
I prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me.	Please, fool, go away.
There’s money for thee.	Here’s money for you.

What wouldst thou now?	What are you going to do now?
If thou darest tempt me further, draw thy sword.	If you insist on trying my patience any further, then take out your sword right now.
What, what?	What?
Nay, then I must have an ounce or two of this malapert blood from you.	Because then I’d have to shed an ounce or two of your impudent blood.
Hold, Toby!	Stop, Sir Toby!
On thy life I charge thee, hold!	I order you to stop!
Madam!	Madam!
Will it be ever thus?	Are you always going to be like this?
Out of my sight!— Be not offended, dear Cesario.— Rudesby, be gone!	Get out of my sight!—Dear Cesario, please don’t be offended.—Get out of here, you barbarian!
Thou shalt not choose but go.	You have to come with me.

A dry jest, sir.	Just a bit of my dry humor, sir.
Are you full of them?	Are you always so funny?
Marry, now I let go your hand, I am barren.	But oops, when I let go of your hand, I let go of the biggest joke of all.
O knight, thou lackest a cup of canary.	Sir, you need a drink.
When did I see thee so put down?	When has anyone ever put you down like that.
Never in your life, I think, unless you see canary put me down.	Never.
Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has.	Sometimes I think I’m no smarter than average.
If it be thus to dream, still let me sleep!	If this is a dream, let me keep on sleeping!

Jove bless thee, master Parson.	God bless you, Mr.
Bonos dies, Sir Toby.	Priest.
To him, Sir Topas.	Go to him, Sir Topas.
The knave counterfeits well.	The fool’s a good actor.
A good knave.	A good fool.
Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, go to my lady— Out, hyperbolical fiend!	Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, please go find my lady Olivia— Get out, demon!
How vexest thou this man!	Why are you bothering this poor man!
Talkest thou nothing but of ladies?	Can’t you talk about anything besides ladies?
Fie, thou dishonest Satan!	You should be ashamed of yourself, Satan, you liar!
I call thee by the most modest terms, for I am one of those gentle ones that will use the devil himself with courtesy.	I’m being gentle with you, because I’m one of those good-hearted people who are polite to the devil himself.
Sayest thou that house is dark?	You call this house dark?
As hell, Sir Topas.	Dark as hell, Sir Topas.
Why, it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes, and the clerestories toward the south-north are as lustrous as ebony.	But it has bay windows that are as transparent as stone walls, and the upper windows facing south-north are as clear as coal.
And yet complainest thou of obstruction?	But you’re still complaining of darkness and a bad view?
I am not mad, Sir Topas.	I’m not insane, Sir Topas.
I say to you this house is dark.	I’m telling you, this house is dark.
Madman, thou errest.	You’re wrong, you madman.
I say, there is no darkness but ignorance, in which thou art more puzzled than the Egyptians in their fog.	There’s no darkness except ignorance, and you’re more ignorant than the Egyptians during the plague of fog.
I say, this house is as dark as ignorance, though ignorance were as dark as hell.	I tell you, this house is as dark as ignorance.
I am no more mad than you are.	I’m no more insane than you are, and I’ll prove it.
Make the trial of it in any constant question.	Ask me any commonsense question.
What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wildfowl?	What was the philosopher Pythagoras’s belief about wild birds?
That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird.	That our grandmother’s soul could end up inhabiting a bird.
What thinkest thou of his opinion?	What do you think of his belief?
I think nobly of the soul, and no way approve his opinion.	I respect the soul very much, so I disagree with his belief.
Fare thee well.	Well then, goodbye.
Remain thou still in darkness.	Stay in the dark.
Thou shalt hold the opinion of Pythagoras ere I will allow of thy wits, and fear to kill a woodcock lest thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam.	I’ll only admit that you’re sane when you agree with Pythagoras and hesitate to kill a bird because it might contain your grandmother’s soul.
Fare thee well.	Goodbye.
Sir Topas, Sir Topas!	Sir Topas, Sir Topas!
My most exquisite Sir Topas!	The brilliant Sir Topas!
Nay, I am for all waters.	I can do anything!
Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and gown.	You could’ve done this without your beard and gown.
He sees thee not.	He couldn’t see you.
To him in thine own voice, and bring me word how thou findest him.	Now talk to him in your own voice, and tell me how he is.
I would we were well rid of this knavery.	I wish this trick would be over.
If he may be conveniently delivered, I would he were, for I am now so far in offense with my niece that I cannot pursue with any safety this sport to the upshot.	I’m in so much trouble with my niece that it wouldn’t be safe to let this prank go to its conclusion.
Come by and by to my chamber.	Come to my room later on.
Fool!	Fool!
Fool!	Fool!
Fool, I say!	Fool, I say!
Good fool, as ever thou wilt deserve well at my hand, help me to a candle, and pen, ink, and paper.	Good fool, good jester, I’ll make it worth your while if you get me a candle, and a pen, ink and paper.
As I am a gentleman, I will live to be thankful to thee for ’t.	You have my word as a gentleman that I’ll always be grateful to you.
Master Malvolio?	Master Malvolio?
Ay, good fool.	Yes, good fool.
But as well?	As sane as me?
Then you are mad indeed, if you be no better in your wits than a fool.	Then you really are insane, if you’re no saner than a fool.
Sir Topas!	Sir Topas!
Fool, fool, fool, I say!	Fool, fool, hey, fool!
Alas, sir, be patient.	Please, sir, be quiet.
What say you sir?	What do you want to say, sir?
Good fool, help me to some light and some paper.	Be a nice fool and help me find a candle and some paper.
I tell thee, I am as well in my wits as any man in Illyria.	I tell you, I’m as sane as any man in Illyria.
Well-a-day that you were, sir.	If only you were, sir.
By this hand, I am.	I swear I am.
Good fool, some ink, paper, and light, and convey what I will set down to my lady.	Get me some ink, paper, and a candle.
It shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing of letter did.	You’ll get a bigger reward than you ever got delivering a letter before.
I will help you to ’t.	I’ll help you.
But tell me true, are you not mad indeed?	But tell me honestly, are you sure you’re not insane?
Or do you but counterfeit?	Or are you just pretending?
Believe me, I am not.	Believe me, I’m not.
I tell thee true.	I’m telling the truth.
Nay, I’ll ne'er believe a madman till I see his brains.	I’ll never believe a madman until I can see his brains.
I will fetch you light, and paper, and ink.	But I’ll get you a candle and paper and ink.
Fool, I’ll requite it in the highest degree.	Fool, I’ll repay you for this favor.
I prithee, be gone.	Please, hurry.
This is the air, that is the glorious sun.	This is the air, that’s the glorious sun.
Where’s Antonio, then?	Where’s Antonio, then?
I could not find him at the Elephant.	I didn’t find him at the Elephant.
Yet there he was, and there I found this credit, That he did range the town to seek me out.	But he’d been there before me, and they told me he’d gone out looking for me.
His counsel now might do me golden service.	I could really use his advice right now.
There’s something in ’t That is deceivable.	There’s something going on that’s not what it seems.
But here the lady comes.	But here she comes.
I’ll follow this good man, and go with you; And, having sworn truth, ever will be true.	I’ll follow the priest and go with you; and after I’ve sworn to be faithful, I’ll be faithful forever.
Then lead the way, good father; and heavens so shine That they may fairly note this act of mine.	Then lead the way, father.
Now, as thou lovest me, let me see his letter.	If you’re my friend, you’ll let me see his letter.
Good Master Fabian, grant me another request.	Dear Mr. Fabian, do me another favor first.
Anything.	Anything.
Do not desire to see this letter.	Don’t ask to see this letter.
Belong you to the Lady Olivia, friends?	My friends, are you all Lady Olivia’s servants?
Ay, sir, we are some of her trappings.	Yes, sir, we’re part of her entourage.
I know thee well.	I know you.
How dost thou, my good fellow?	How are you, my friend?
Truly, sir, the better for my foes and the worse for my friends.	I’m better off because of my enemies, and worse off because of my friends.
The better for thy friends.	You’re better off because of your friends.
No, sir, the worse.	No, sir, worse off.
How can that be?	How can that be?
I’ll ride home tomorrow, Sir Toby.	By the way, I’m going home tomorrow, Sir Toby.
Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.	What does  You’d have a great hairstyle if you had.
Why, would that have mended my hair?	Why, would that have fixed my hair?
Past question, for thou seest it will not curl by nature.	Oh, no question—it won’t style itself.
But it becomes me well enough, does ’t not?	But my hair looks good anyway, doesn’t it?
Excellent.	It looks great.
It hangs like flax on a distaff.	It hangs like an old worn-out mop.
Faith, I’ll home tomorrow, Sir Toby.	Listen, I’m going home tomorrow, Sir Toby.
The count himself here hard by woos her.	That duke who lives nearby is courting her.
I have heard her swear ’t.	I’ve heard her say that.
Tut, there’s life in ’t, man.	So cheer up, there’s still hope for you, man.
Marry, sir, they praise me and make an ass of me, now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass.	Well, my friends praise me and make me look like an idiot, while my enemies tell me straightforwardly that I am an idiot.
So that by my foes, sir I profit in the knowledge of myself, and by my friends, I am abused.	My enemies help me understand myself better, which is an advantage, and my friends help me lie about myself, which is a disadvantage.
So that, conclusions to be as kisses, if your four negatives make your two affirmatives, why then the worse for my friends and the better for my foes.	So if four negatives make two affirmatives, I’m worse off because of my friends and better off because of my foes.
Why, this is excellent.	That’s excellent.
By my troth, sir, no—though it please you to be one of my friends.	Don’t say that—unless you want to be one of my friends.
Thou shalt not be the worse for me: there’s gold.	That’s a nice hand you dealt me.
But that it would be double-dealing, sir, I would you could make it another.	But if it’s not double-dealing, sir, I wish you’d deal me another.
O, you give me ill counsel.	Oh, you’re a naughty one, encouraging double-dealing.
Well, I will be so much a sinner, to be a double-dealer.	Well, I’ll commit the sin of double-dealing, and deal you a second coin.
There’s another.	Here it is.
Primo, secundo, tertio is a good play, and the old saying is, the third pays for all.	And maybe a third?
The triplex, sir, is a good tripping measure, or the bells of Saint Bennet, sir, may put you in mind—one, two, three.	The three-beat rhythm is a good for dancing, and the church bells chime—one, two, three.
You can fool no more money out of me at this throw.	You can’t get any more money out of me right now.
If you will let your lady know I am here to speak with her, and bring her along with you, it may awake my bounty further.	If you tell your lady I’m here to speak with her, and bring her out with you when you come back, you might make me more generous.
Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come again.	Well then, sing a lullaby to your generosity: it’ll nap until I come back.
I go, sir, but I would not have you to think that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness.	But don’t think I’m doing this because I’m greedy.
But, as you say, sir, let your bounty take a nap, I will awake it anon.	I’ll be back soon to wake up your generosity.
Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue me.	Here comes the man who rescued me, sir.
That face of his I do remember well.	I remember his face well.
Yet, when I saw it last, it was besmeared As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war.	Though the last time I saw him it was black from the smoke of war.
A baubling vessel was he captain of, For shallow draught and bulk unprizable, With which such scathful grapple did he make With the most noble bottom of our fleet, That very envy and the tongue of loss Cried fame and honor on him.—What’s the matter?	He was the captain of a flimsy boat that was practically worthless because it was so small.
Orsino, this is that Antonio That took the  And this is he that did the  When your young nephew Titus lost his leg.	Orsino, this is the same Antonio who took the
He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side, But in conclusion put strange speech upon me.	But then he said strange things to me.
I know not what ’twas but distraction.	I don’t know what else it could be.
Notable pirate!	But you’re a famous pirate!
Orsino, noble sir, Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me.	Orsino, sir, please don’t call me those names.
Antonio never yet was thief or pirate, Though, I confess, on base and ground enough, Orsino’s enemy.	I was never a thief or a pirate, though I admit I was your enemy for good reasons.
That most ingrateful boy there by your side From the rude sea’s enraged and foamy mouth Did I redeem.	I rescued that ungrateful boy next to you from drowning.
A wreck past hope he was.	He was a wreck, almost past hope.
His life I gave him and did thereto add My love, without retention or restraint, All his in dedication.	I saved his life and gave him my love, without reservation.
How can this be?	How is that possible?
Here comes the Countess.	Ah, the countess is coming!
Now heaven walks on earth.	An angel is walking on earth.
What would my lord, but that he may not have, Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable?	What can I give you that you want, my lord, except the one thing you can’t have?
Cesario, you do not keep promise with me.	Cesario, you missed your appointment with me.
Madam?	Madam?
Gracious Olivia— What do you say, Cesario?—Good my lord— My lord would speak.	Dearest Olivia— What do you have to say for yourself, Cesario?—My lord, please— My lord wants to speak.
My duty hushes me.	It’s my duty to be quiet.
Still so cruel?	Are you still so cruel?
Still so constant, lord.	I am still so faithful, my lord.
What, to perverseness?	What, faithful to being mean and nasty?
You, uncivil lady, To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars My soul the faithfull’st off'rings have breathed out That e'er devotion tendered—what shall I do?	I breathed from my soul the most faithful offerings to your ungrateful altars that any devoted person has ever offered—what more am I supposed to do?
Even what it please my lord that shall become him.	You can do whatever you want as long as it’s socially appropriate.
Come, boy, with me.	Come with me, boy.
And I, most jocund, apt, and willingly, To do you rest, a thousand deaths would die.	And I would die a thousand deaths cheerfully, if it made your life easier.
Where goes Cesario?	Where’s Cesario going?
Ay me, detested!	That’s the truth.
Who does beguile you?	Who tricked you?
Who does do you wrong?	Who treated you badly?
Hast thou forgot thyself?	Have you completely forgotten?
Is it so long?— Call forth the holy father.	Has it been so long?
Come, away!	Call the priest.
Whither, my lord?—Cesario, husband, stay.	Go where, my lord?—Cesario, my husband, stay here.
Husband?	Husband?
Ay, husband.	Yes, husband.
Can he that deny?	Can he deny it?
Her husband, sirrah?	Are you her husband, boy?
No, my lord, not I. Alas, it is the baseness of thy fear That makes thee strangle thy propriety.	No, my lord, not me.
Fear not, Cesario.	But don’t be afraid, Cesario.
Be that thou know’st thou art, and then thou art As great as that thou fear’st.	Be the person you know you are, and you’ll be as powerful as this person you fear.
O, welcome, father!	Oh, hello, father!
Father, I charge thee, by thy reverence, Here to unfold (though lately we intended To keep in darkness what occasion now Reveals before ’tis ripe) what thou dost know Hath newly passed between this youth and me.	Father, could I please ask you to tell these people what happened between me and this young man?
My lord, I do protest—    O, do not swear!	My lord, I swear to you— Oh, don’t swear!
Hold little faith, though thou hast too much fear.	Keep a little bit of honesty, even if you’re afraid.
For the love of God, a surgeon!	For the love of God, call a doctor!
Send one presently to Sir Toby.	Sir Toby needs help right away.
What’s the matter?	What’s the matter?
He has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby a bloody coxcomb too.	He cut my head and gave Sir Toby a bloody head, too.
For the love of God, your help!	For the love of God, help us!
I had rather than forty pound I were at home.	I’d give forty pounds to be safe at home right now.
Who has done this, Sir Andrew?	Who did this, Sir Andrew?
The Count’s gentleman, one Cesario.	The count’s messenger, Cesario.
We took him for a coward, but he’s the very devil incardinate.	We thought he was a coward, but he fights like a devil.
My gentleman, Cesario?	My Cesario?
Od’s lifelings, here he is!—You broke my head for nothing, and that that I did, I was set on to do ’t by Sir Toby.	Anything I did to you, I did it because Sir Toby made me.
Why do you speak to me?	Why are you talking like this?
I never hurt you.	I never hurt you.
If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me.	If a bloody head counts as a hurt, then you hurt me.
I think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb.	Apparently you think there’s nothing unusual about a bloody head.
Here comes Sir Toby halting.	Here comes Sir Toby, limping.
You shall hear more.	He’ll tell you more of the story.
But if he had not been in drink, he would have tickled you othergates than he did.	If he hadn’t been drunk, he would’ve really roughed you up.
How now, gentleman?	Hello, sir!
How is ’t with you?	How are you?
That’s all one: has hurt me, and there’s the end on ’t.	It doesn’t matter how I am: he hurt me, and that’s that.
FOOL Oh, he’s drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone.	Oh, he’s drunk, Sir Toby, for a whole hour now.
His eyes were set at eight i' the morning.	His eyes started glazing over around eight in the morning.
Then he’s a rogue, and a passy-measures pavin.	Then he’s no good.
I hate a drunken rogue.	I hate no-good drunks.
Away with him!	Take him away!
Who hath made this havoc with them?	Who did this to him?
I’ll help you, Sir Toby, because we’ll be dressed together.	I’ll help you, Sir Toby.
Will you help?—An ass-head, and a coxcomb, and a knave, a thin-faced knave, a gull!	Will you help me?—What an ass and a fool, a gullible no-good idiot!
Get him to bed, and let his hurt be looked to.	Get him to bed and make sure his wounds are treated.

Sebastian are you?	Are you Sebastian?
Fear’st thou that, Antonio?	Do you have any doubts, Antonio?
How have you made division of yourself?	How did you divide yourself in two?
An apple, cleft in two, is not more twin Than these two creatures.	These two people are as identical as two halves of an apple.
Which is Sebastian?	Which one is Sebastian?
Most wonderful!	How unbelievable!
Sebastian was my father; Such a Sebastian was my brother too, So went he suited to his watery tomb.	Sebastian was my father’s name, and my brother was named Sebastian too.
A spirit I am indeed, But am in that dimension grossly clad Which from the womb I did participate.	I am a spirit, yes, since I have a soul.
Were you a woman, as the rest goes even, I should my tears let fall upon your cheek And say “Thrice-welcome, drownèd Viola!” My father had a mole upon his brow.	If you were a woman, I’d hug you now and cry, and say “Welcome back, drowned Viola!” My father had a mole on his forehead.
And so had mine.	Mine did too.
And died that day when Viola from her birth Had numbered thirteen years.	He died on Viola’s thirteenth birthday.
I’ll stay a month longer.	All right, I’ll stay another month.
I am a fellow o' th' strangest mind i' th' world.	Ah, I’m an odd kind of guy.
I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether.	Sometimes all I want to do is see plays and go out dancing.
Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?	Are you good at those kinds of things?
Wherefore are these things hid?	Why do you hide these things?
Wherefore have these gifts a curtain before 'em?	Why do you keep these talents behind a curtain?
Are they like to take dust, like Mistress Mall’s picture?	Are they likely to get dusty?
Why dost thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in a coranto?	Why don’t you go off to church dancing one way, and come home dancing another way?
I would not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace.	I wouldn’t even pee without dancing a waltz.
What dost thou mean?	What are you thinking?
Is it a world to hide virtues in?	Is this the kind of world where we hide our accomplishments?
I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy leg, it was formed under the star of a galliard.	Look how shapely your legs are.
Ay, ’tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a dun-colored stock.	That’s true.
What shall we do else?	Why not?
Were we not born under Taurus?	Weren’t we both born under Taurus?

He shall enlarge him.	He’ll release him.
A most extracting frenzy of mine own From my remembrance clearly banished his.	I was so crazy myself that I forgot all about him.
Truly, madam, he holds Beelzebub at the staves' end as well as a man in his case may do.	Well, he keeps the devil away as well as a man can in his situation.
Has here writ a letter to you.	He’s written you a letter.
I should have given ’t you today morning, but as a madman’s epistles are no gospels, so it skills not much when they are delivered.	I would’ve given it to you this morning, but a madman’s letters aren’t Gospel, so it doesn’t matter much if I’m a bit late.
Open ’t, and read it.	Open it and read it.
Look then to be well edified when the fool delivers the madman.	There’s a lot to learn when a fool recites the words of a madman.
How now?	Why are you talking like that?
Art thou mad?	Are you insane?
No, madam, I do but read madness.	No, madam, I’m just reading an insane letter.
An your ladyship will have it as it ought to be, you must allow  Prithee, read i' thy right wits.	If you want things done in the right way, you’ll have to let me read a crazy letter in a crazy voice.
So I do, madonna.	No, please, read it like a sane person.
But to read his right wits is to read thus.	I will, my lady, but a sane person reading this would make it sound crazy.
Therefore perpend, my princess, and give ear.	So listen up, princess.
By the Lord, madam, you wrong me, and the world shall know it.	I swear to God, madam, you’ve wronged me, and I’ll tell the whole world.
Though you have put me into darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over me, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as your Ladyship.	You’ve shut me up in a dark room and given your drunken cousin authority over me, but I’m as sane as you are.
Think of me as you please.	I don’t care what you think of me.
I leave my duty a little unthought of and speak out of my injury.	I’m going to forget my duties to you a little bit and complain about the injuries you’ve caused me.
The madly used Malvolio.”  Did he write this?	Signed,    The poorly treated Malvolio.” Did he write this?
Ay, madam.	Yes, madam.
This savors not much of distraction.	Set him free.
See him delivered, Fabian; bring him hither.	Fabian, bring him here.
Madam, I am most apt to embrace your offer.	I accept that offer happily, madam.
Is this the madman?	Is this the madman?
Ay, my lord, this same.	Yes, my lord.
How now, Malvolio!	How are you, Malvolio?
Madam, you have done me wrong, Notorious wrong.	Madam, you’ve treated me badly, very badly.
Have I, Malvolio?	I did, Malvolio?
No.	No.
Tell me why.	Tell me why you did it.
Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing, Though, I confess, much like the character.	I’m sorry, Malvolio, but this isn’t my writing, though I admit it looks like mine.
But out of question, ’tis Maria’s hand.	It’s definitely Maria’s handwriting.
And now I do bethink me, it was she First told me thou wast mad, then camest in smiling, And in such forms which here were presupposed Upon thee in the letter.	Now that I think about it, Maria was the one who first told me you were insane.
Prithee, be content.	I promise.
Why, “some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrown upon them.” I was one, sir, in this interlude, one Sir Topas, sir, but that’s all one.	Well, you know, “some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.” Anyway, I was part of the trick, sir.
He hath been most notoriously abused.	He really was tricked horribly.
Pursue him and entreat him to a peace.	Go after him and try to calm him down a little.
He hath not told us of the captain yet.	He still hasn’t told us about the captain.
Cesario, come, For so you shall be, while you are a man.	Cesario, come here.
Taurus!	Taurus!
That’s sides and heart.	That governs the torso and heart, doesn’t it?
No, sir, it is legs and thighs.	No, the legs and thighs.
Let me see the caper.	Let me see you dance.
He hath known you but three days, and already you are no stranger.	He’s only known you for three days, but he’s already treating you like a close friend.
No, believe me.	No, not at all.
I thank you.	Thanks for telling me.
Here comes the count.	Here comes the Duke now.
Who saw Cesario, ho?	Has anyone seen Cesario?
Be clamorous, and leap all civil bounds, Rather than make unprofited return.	Be loud and obnoxious.
I think not so, my lord.	I don’t think so, my lord.
Dear lad, believe it.	My boy, it’s true.
For they shall yet belie thy happy years That say thou art a man.	Anyone who says you’re a man must not notice how young you are.
I know thy constellation is right apt For this affair.	I know you’re the right person for this job.
I’ll do my best To woo your lady— Whoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife.	I’ll do my best to make this lady love you.
Give me excess of it that, surfeiting, The appetite may sicken, and so die.	Give me too much of it, so I’ll get sick of it and stop loving.
Oh, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound, That breathes upon a bank of violets, Stealing and giving odor.	Oh, it sounded like a sweet breeze blowing gently over a bank of violets, taking their scent with it.
Tis not so sweet now as it was before.	It doesn’t sound as sweet as it did before.
So full of shapes is fancy That it alone is high fantastical.	Love is so vivid and fantastical that nothing compares to it.
Will you go hunt, my lord?	Do you want to go hunting, my lord?
What, Curio?	Hunting what, Curio?
My lady will hang thee for thy absence.	Lady Olivia will have you executed for not showing up.
Let her hang me.	So let her execute me.
Make that good.	How do you know?
He shall see none to fear.	Well, he’ll be dead, so he won’t see anything.
A good lenten answer.	That’s a lame answer.
I can tell thee where that saying was born, of “I fear no colors.”  Where, good Mistress Mary?	Where, good Miss Mary?
In the wars.	From soldiers.
Well, God give them wisdom that have it.	Well, we all have our special gifts.
Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent.	But still, she’s going to kill you for being gone so long.
You are resolute, then?	You’ve made up your mind, then?
Well, go thy way.	Well, go along now.
If Sir Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a piece of Eve’s flesh as any in Illyria.	You’d be the funniest person in Illyria… if Sir Toby ever stopped drinking.
Peace, you rogue, no more o' that.	Shut up, you troublemaker, no more of that.
Here comes my lady.	Here comes my lady.
Take the fool away.	Get that fool out of here.
Do you not hear, fellows?	Didn’t you hear her, guys?
Take away the lady.	Get the lady out of here.
Go to, you’re a dry fool.	Oh, go away, you’re a boring fool.
I’ll no more of you.	I don’t want to have anything to do with you anymore.
Besides, you grow dishonest.	Besides, you’ve gotten unreliable.
If he cannot, let the botcher mend him.	If he cannot, let the tailor mend him.
Anything that’s mended is but patched.	Anything that’s mended is only patched up.
Virtue that transgresses is but patched with sin, and sin that amends is but patched with virtue.	A good person who does something wrong is only patched up with sin.
If that this simple syllogism will serve, so.	If this logic works, that’s great.
If it will not, what remedy?	If not, what can you do about it?
Sir, I bade them take away you.	I told them to take  Oh, what a big mistake!
Good madonna, give me leave to prove you a fool.	Please let me prove you’re a fool.
Can you do it?	Can you do that?
Dexterously, good madonna.	Easily, madam.
I must catechise you for it, madonna.	I’ll have to ask you some questions, madam.
Good my mouse of virtue, answer me.	Please answer, my good little student.
Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I’ll bide your proof.	I’m listening to you only because I’ve got nothing better to do.
Good madonna, why mournest thou?	My dear madam, why are you in mourning?
Good fool, for my brother’s death.	My dear fool, because my brother died.
I think his soul is in hell, madonna.	I think his soul’s in hell, my lady.
I know his soul is in heaven, fool.	I know his soul’s in heaven, fool.
The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother’s soul being in heaven.	Then you’re a fool for being sad that your brother’s soul is in heaven.
Take away the fool, gentlemen.	Take away this fool, gentlemen.
What think you of this fool, Malvolio?	What do you think of this fool, Malvolio?
Doth he not mend?	Isn’t he getting funnier?
Yes, and shall do till the pangs of death shake him.	Yes, and he’ll keep getting funnier till he dies.
Infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the better fool.	Old age always makes people act funny—even wise people, but fools more than anybody.
God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the better increasing your folly!	I hope you go senile soon, sir, so you can become a more foolish fool!
Sir Toby will be sworn that I am no fox, but he will not pass his word for two pence that you are no fool.	Sir Toby would bet a fortune that I’m not smart, but he wouldn’t bet two cents that you’re not a fool.
How say you to that, Malvolio?	What do you say to that, Malvolio?
I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal.	I’m surprised you enjoy the company of this stupid troublemaker.
I saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool that	The other day I saw him defeated in a
I protest I take these wise men that crow so at these set kind of fools no better than the fools' zanies.	I swear, anyone smart who laughs at these courts jesters is nothing but a jester’s apprentice.
Oh, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste with a distempered appetite.	Malvolio, your vanity is damaging your good taste.
Now Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou speakest well of fools!	You speak so highly of fools!
Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires to speak with you.	Madam, there’s a young gentleman at the gate who really wants to speak to you.
From the Count Orsino, is it?	Was he sent by Count Orsino?
I know not, madam.	I don’t know, madam.
Tis a fair young man, and well attended.	He’s a good-looking young man, and there are a lot of people with him.
Who of my people hold him in delay?	Who’s talking to him now?
Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman.	Sir Toby, madam, your relative.
He speaks nothing but madman.	He talks nothing but nonsense.
If it be a suit from the count, I am sick, or not at home.	If he’s got a message from the count, tell him I’m sick, or not home.
What is he at the gate, cousin?	Who’s that at the gate, uncle?
A gentleman.	A gentleman.
A gentleman?	A gentleman?
What gentleman?	What gentleman?
Good Sir Toby!	There’s some gentleman out there.— Good Sir Toby!
Lechery!	Nonsense.
I defy lechery.	I defy brain-death!
There’s one at the gate.	I told you, someone’s at the gate.
Ay, marry, what is he?	Yes, but who is he?
Let him be the devil, an he will, I care not.	Let him be the devil if he wants to, I don’t care.
Give me faith, say I.	God will protect me.
What’s a drunken man like, fool?	Tell me what a drunk is like, fool.
Like a drowned man, a fool and a madman.	He’s a fool, a madman, and a drowned man.
One draught above heat makes him a fool, the second mads him, and a third drowns him.	The first drink makes him a fool, the second makes him crazy, and the third drowns him.
Go look after him.	Go take care of him.
Madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with you.	Madam, that young man out there says he’s got to speak to you.
I told him you were sick.	I told him you were sick.
He takes on him to understand so much, and therefore comes to speak with you.	He claimed he knew that, and that’s why he’s come to speak with you.
I told him you were asleep.	I told him you were asleep.
He seems to have a foreknowledge of that too, and therefore comes to speak with you.	He claimed to know that already too, and said that’s the reason he’s come to speak with you.
What is to be said to him, lady?	What can I say to him, lady?
He’s fortified against any denial.	He’s got an answer for everything.
Tell him he shall not speak with me.	Tell him he’s not going to speak with me.
What manner of man?	Just a man, like any other.
Of very ill manner.	But what’s he like?
He’ll speak with you, will you or no.	He insists he’ll speak with you whether you want him to or not.
Of what personage and years is he?	How old is he?
Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for a boy, as a squash is before ’tis a peascod, or a codling when ’tis almost an apple.	Not old enough to be a man, but not young enough to be a boy.
Tis with him in standing water, between boy and man.	He’s somewhere between boy and man.
He is very well-favored, and he speaks very shrewishly.	He’s very handsome and speaks well, but he’s very young.
One would think his mother’s milk were scarce out of him.	He looks like he just recently stopped breastfeeding.
Let him approach.	Show him in.
Call in my gentlewoman.	Call in my maid.
Gentlewoman, my lady calls.	Maria, our lady wants you.
Give me my veil.	Give me my veil.
Come, throw it o'er my face.	Come, put it over my face.
The honorable lady of the house, which is she?	Which one of you is the lady of the house?
Speak to me.	You can speak to me.
I shall answer for her.	I represent her.
Your will?	What do you want?
Most radiant, exquisite and unmatchable beauty—I pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house, for I never saw her.	What stunning, exquisite, and unmatchable beauty—but please, tell me if you’re the lady of the house, because I’ve never seen her.
I would be loath to cast away my speech, for besides that it is excellently well penned, I have taken great pains to con it.	I’d hate to waste my speech on the wrong person, because It’s very well written and I spent a lot of time and energy memorizing it.
Good beauties, let me sustain no scorn.	Beautiful ladies, please don’t treat me badly.
I am very comptible, even to the least sinister usage.	I’m very sensitive, and even the smallest bit of rudeness hurts my feelings.
Whence came you, sir?	Where do you come from, sir?
I can say little more than I have studied, and that question’s out of my part.	I’m sorry, but I memorized what I’m supposed to say here today, and that question isn’t part of the speech I learned.
Good gentle one, give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the house, that I may proceed in my speech.	Please, my lady, just confirm that you’re the lady of the house so I can get on with my speech.
Are you a comedian?	Are you an actor?
No, my profound heart.	No, madam.
And yet, by the very fangs of malice I swear, I am not that I play.	But I swear I’m not the person I’m playing.
Are you the lady of the house?	Are you the lady of the house?
If I do not usurp myself, I am.	I am, unless I somehow stole this role.
Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp yourself, for what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve.	If you’re the lady of the house, then it’s true you’re stealing your role, because what’s yours to give away is not yours to keep for yourself.
But this is from my commission.	But that’s not part of what I’m supposed to say.
I will on with my speech in your praise and then show you the heart of my message.	I’ll go on with my speech praising you, and then I’ll get to the point.
Come to what is important in ’t.	Get to the point now.
I forgive you the praise.	I’ll let you get away with skipping the praise.
Alas, I took great pains to study it, and ’tis poetical.	That’s too bad, because I spent a long time memorizing it, and it’s poetic.
It is the more like to be feigned.	That means it’s more likely to be fake.
I pray you, keep it in.	Please, keep it to yourself.
If you be not mad, be gone.	If you’re just insane, then get out of here.
Will you hoist sail, sir?	Ready to set sail, sir?
Here lies your way.	The door’s right here.
Tell me your mind.	Tell me what you want.
Speak your office.	Tell me what it’s about.
It alone concerns your ear.	It’s about you.
I bring no overture of war, no taxation of homage.	I’m not bringing any declarations of war or demands for cash.
My words are as full of peace as matter.	I’m coming in peace.
Yet you began rudely.	But you began so rudely.
What are you?	Who are you?
What would you?	What do you want?
How now!	What’s going on?
What news from her?	What have you heard from her?
Away before me to sweet beds of flowers.	Take me to the garden.
What I am and what I would are as secret as maidenhead.	Who I am and what I want are a secret.
Give us the place alone.	Everyone, please leave us alone for a moment.
Most sweet lady— A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it.	Most sweet lady— Oh, “sweet”!
Where lies your text?	Where’s the passage of holy scripture that you’re basing your sermon on?
In Orsino’s bosom.	In Orsino’s heart.
In his bosom?	In his heart?
In what chapter of his bosom?	In what chapter and verse of his heart?
To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.	The table of contents says it’s in the first chapter of his heart.
Oh, I have read it.	Oh, I’ve read that.
It is heresy.	That’s not holy, it’s heresy.
Have you no more to say?	Do you have anything else to say?
Good madam, let me see your face.	Madam, please let me see your face.
Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face?	Has your lord given you any orders to negotiate with my face?
You are now out of your text.	You’re overstepping your bounds now.
But we will draw the curtain and show you the picture.	But I’ll open the curtain and let you see the picture.
Look you, sir, such a one I was this present.	Look, sir, this is a portrait of me as I am at this particular moment.
Is ’t not well done?	It’s pretty well done, isn’t it?
Twill endure wind and weather.	Wind and rain can’t wash it off.
O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted.	Oh, I’d never be that cruel.
I will give out divers schedules of my beauty.	I’ll write out a detailed inventory of my beauty and label every part.
But, if you were the devil, you are fair.	But you’d still be gorgeous even if you were as proud as the devil.
My lord and master loves you.	My lord loves you.
How does he love me?	How does he love me?
Your lord does know my mind.	Your lord knows what I think.
I cannot love him.	I can’t love him.
Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble, Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth.	I know he’s noble, rich, young, and with a fine reputation.
In voices well divulged, free, learned, and valiant; And in dimension and the shape of nature A gracious person.	People say he’s generous, well educated, and brave, and he’s very attractive.
But yet I cannot love him; He might have took his answer long ago.	But I just can’t love him.
Why, what would you?	What would you do about it?
Make me a willow cabin at your gate And call upon my soul within the house.	From that cabin I’d call out to my soul.
Write loyal cantons of contemned love And sing them loud even in the dead of night.	I’d write sad songs about unrequited love and sing them loudly in the middle of the night.
You might do much.	Not bad; you might accomplish something.
Above my fortunes, yet my state is well.	But I’m still fairly high-ranking.
I am a gentleman.	I’m a gentleman.
Get you to your lord.	Go back to your lord.
I cannot love him.	I can’t love him.
Let him send no more— Unless perchance you come to me again To tell me how he takes it.	Tell him not to send any more messengers—unless you feel like coming back to tell me how he took the bad news.
Fare you well.	Goodbye.
I thank you for your pains.	Thanks for your trouble.
Spend this for me.	Here’s some money for you.
I am no fee’d post, lady.	I’m not a paid messenger, my lady.
Keep your purse.	Keep your money.
My master, not myself, lacks recompense.	It’s my master who’s not getting the reward he deserves, not me.
Farewell, fair cruelty.	Goodbye, you beautiful, cruel woman.
What is your parentage?” “Above my fortunes, yet my state is well.	But I’m still fairly high-ranking.
Not too fast!	Ah, no.
Soft, soft!	Calm down, calm down.
Unless the master were the man.	If only his lord were more like him.
How now?	How strange I’m feeling!
Even so quickly may one catch the plague?	Can someone fall in love this quickly?
Well, let it be.— What ho, Malvolio!	Come here!
Here, madam, at your service.	At your service, madam.
Run after that same peevish messenger, The county’s man.	Run after that obnoxious messenger, the duke’s servant.
He left this ring behind him, Would I or not.	He insisted on leaving this ring with me whether I wanted it or not.
Madam, I will.	Madam, I will.
I do I know not what and fear to find Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind.	I don’t know what I’m doing.
Fate, show thy force.	Fate, do your work.
Ourselves we do not owe.	We human beings don’t control our own destinies.
What is decreed must be, and be this so.	What is fated to happen must happen.
By your patience, no.	No, I’d rather you stayed here.
Let me yet know of you whither you are bound.	At least tell me where you’re going.
No, sooth, sir.	Honestly, I can’t.
My determinate voyage is mere extravagancy.	I’m just wandering, with no particular destination.
But I perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty that you will not extort from me what I am willing to keep in.	But I know you’d never force me to tell you things I don’t want to, so I should be polite and tell you what I can.
He left behind him myself and a sister, both born in an hour.	He left behind myself and my twin sister, who was born in the same hour as me.
If the heavens had been pleased, would we had so ended!	If God had been willing, I wish we had died in the same hour too!
But you, sir, altered that, for some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was my sister drowned.	An hour before you pulled me out of the breaking waves, my sister drowned.
Alas the day!	How tragic!
A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled me, was yet of many accounted beautiful.	Although many people said she looked like me, she was considered beautiful.
She is drowned already, sir, with salt water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more.	She’s been drowned in salty sea water, and now my salty tears are about to drown her memory all over again.
O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.	Oh, Antonio, I’m sorry I caused you so much trouble.
If you will not murder me for my love, let me be your servant.	Please let me be your servant so I can be with you.
Fare you well at once.	I like you very much.
I am bound to the Count Orsino’s court.	I’m going to Count Orsino’s court.
Farewell.	Goodbye.
The gentleness of all the gods go with thee!	I wish you all the best.
I have many enemies in Orsino’s court, Else would I very shortly see thee there.	If I didn’t have so many enemies in Orsino’s court, I’d go join you there.
But, come what may, I do adore thee so That danger shall seem sport, and I will go.	But who cares.
Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia?	Excuse me, weren’t you with Countess Olivia just now?
Even now, sir.	Yes, sir.
On a moderate pace I have since arrived but hither.	I’ve only made it this far since I left her place, walking at a moderate pace.
She returns this ring to you, sir.	She’s sending this ring back to you, sir.
You might have saved me my pains to have taken it away yourself.	You should’ve saved me some trouble and taken it away yourself.
Receive it so.	Here, take the ring.
She took the ring of me.	She took that ring from me.
I’ll none of it.	I won’t take it back.
Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her, and her will is it should be so returned.	You threw it at her rudely, and she wants you to take it back.
I left no ring with her.	I didn’t give her any ring.
What means this lady?	What’s she trying to say?
Fortune forbid my outside have not charmed her!	I hope she doesn’t have a crush on me!
She made good view of me, indeed so much That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue, For she did speak in starts distractedly.	It’s true she looked at me a lot, in fact, she looked at me so much that she seemed distracted, and couldn’t really finish her sentences very well.
She loves me, sure!	Oh, I really think she loves me!
The cunning of her passion Invites me in this churlish messenger.	creet.
I am the man.	I’m the man she wants.
If it be so, as ’tis, Poor lady, she were better love a dream.	If that’s true, which it is, she might as well be in love with a dream, the poor lady.
How will this fadge?	Ah, how will this all turn out?
What will become of this?	What can possibly fix this situation?
O time, thou must untangle this, not I.	Oh, only time can sort out this mess.
It is too hard a knot for me to untie!	I can’t figure it out by myself!
Approach, Sir Andrew.	Come on, Sir Andrew.
Not to be abed after midnight is to be up betimes, and  Nay, my troth, I know not.	And the doctors say it’s healthy to get up early— I don’t know what the doctors say.
But I know to be up late is to be up late.	All I know is that staying up late is staying up late.
A false conclusion.	A false conclusion.
I hate it as an unfilled can.	I hate your logic as much as I hate an empty drinking cup.
Thou'rt a scholar.	You’re a smart guy.
Let us therefore eat and drink.	So we should eat and drink.
Marian, I say!	Maria!
A stoup of wine!	Bring us some wine!
Here comes the fool, i' faith.	Look, here comes the fool.
How now, my hearts!	Hello, my friends!
Did you never see the picture of “We Three”?	What a pretty picture, three fools all together.
Welcome, ass.	Hello, you idiot.
Now let’s have a catch.	Sing us a song.
What country, friends, is this?	What country is this, friends?
This is Illyria, lady.	This is Illyria, lady.
And what should I do in Illyria?	And what am I supposed to do in Illyria?
My brother he is in Elysium.	My brother is in heaven.
Perchance he is not drown’d.—What think you, sailors?	Or maybe there’s a chance he didn’t drown.—What do you think, sailors?
It is perchance that you yourself were saved.	It was a total fluke that you yourself were saved.
O, my poor brother!	Oh, my poor brother!
And so perchance may he be.	But maybe by some fluke he was saved too.
True, madam.	It’s possible, ma'am.
Know’st thou this country?	Don’t give up yet.
Ay, madam, well, for I was bred and born Not three hours' travel from this very place.	I was born and raised less than three hours from here.
By my troth, the fool has an excellent breast.	I swear, this fool has an excellent singing voice.
My lady has a white hand, and the Myrmidons are no bottle-ale houses.	My girlfriend has beautiful white hands, and great warriors aren’t  Ha, ha!
If one knight give a— Would you have a love song or a song of good life?	Would you rather hear a love song or a song about the good life?
A love song, a love song.	A love song, a love song.
Ay, ay.	Yes, yes.
I care not for good life.	I’m not interested in being good.
Excellent good, i' faith.	That was excellent, really excellent.
Good, good.	Good, very good.
A mellifluous voice, as I am true knight.	A beautiful voice, I swear.
A contagious breath.	His breath stinks.
Very sweet and contagious, i' faith.	Yes, it stinks very sweetly.
Shall we rouse the night owl in a catch that will draw three souls out of one weaver?	Should we sing a round to wake up the night owl?
Shall we do that?	Should we do that?
An you love me, let’s do ’t.	Let’s go for it.
Most certain.	Absolutely.
Let our catch be “Thou Knave.” “Hold thy peace, thou knave,” knight?	Let’s dance to “You Jerk.” You mean, “Shut up, you jerk”?
I shall be constrained in ’t to call thee knave, knight.	So I’ll be forced to call you a jerk, Sir Andrew.
It begins “Hold thy peace.” I shall never begin if I hold my peace.	It starts, “Shut up.” I’ll never be able to start if I shut up.
Good, i' faith.	That’s true.
Come, begin.	But come on, start.
What a caterwauling do you keep here!	You’re making a terrible racket out here!
If my lady have not called up her steward Malvolio and bid him turn you out of doors, never trust me.	Lady Olivia told her servant Malvolio to kick you out of the house.
For the love o' God, peace!	For God’s sake, shut up!
My masters, are you mad?	Are you all crazy?
Or what are you?	What’s wrong with you?
Have you no wit, manners, nor honesty but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night?	Are you making all this noise at this time of night because you have no manners, or because you’re just stupid?
Is there no respect of place, persons, nor time in you?	Don’t you have any respect for anything?
We did keep time, sir, in our catches.	We respected the beat of the song, sir.
Sneck up!	So shut up!
Sir Toby, I must be round with you.	Sir Toby, I’ve got to be frank with you.
My lady bade me tell you, that, though she harbors you as her kinsman, she’s nothing allied to your disorders.	My lady told me to tell you that while she lets you stay at her house because you’re a relative, she doesn’t approve of your behavior.
If you can separate yourself and your misdemeanors, you are welcome to the house.	If you can shape up, you’re welcome to stay in the house.
If not, an it would please you to take leave of her, she is very willing to bid you farewell.	If you can’t, and would prefer to leave, she’s very willing to say goodbye to you.
Nay, good Sir Toby.	No, good Sir Toby.
Out o' tune, sir.	That’s out of tune, sir.
You lie.	You lie.
Yes, by Saint Anne, and ginger shall be hot i' the mouth too.	They certainly will.
Thou'rt i' the right.	You’re right.
Go shake your ears!	Go and wiggle your ears!
Twere as good a deed as to drink when a man’s a-hungry, to challenge him the field and then to break promise with him and make a fool of him.	I could challenge him to a duel and then not show up.
Do ’t, knight.	Do that.
I’ll write thee a challenge.	I’ll write a letter challenging him to a duel on your behalf.
Or I’ll deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth.	Or I’ll deliver your insults to his face.
Sweet Sir Toby, be patient for tonight.	Dear Sir Toby, don’t do anything rash tonight.
Since the youth of the count’s was today with thy lady, she is much out of quiet.	Ever since the Duke’s messenger visited Olivia, she’s been upset.
For Monsieur Malvolio, let me alone with him.	As for Monsieur Malvolio, let me take care of him.
I know I can do it.	I know I can do it.
O, if I thought that, I’d beat him like a dog!	Oh, I’ll beat him up for that!
I have no exquisite reason for ’t, but I have reason good enough.	I don’t have any “brilliant” reason for it, but I have a good enough reason.
And on that vice in him will my revenge find notable cause to work.	That’s the weakness I’ll use to get revenge on him.
What wilt thou do?	What are you going to do?
I can write very like my lady your niece: on a forgotten matter we can hardly make distinction of our hands.	I can make my handwriting look just like Lady Olivia’s: she
Excellent!	Excellent!
I have ’t in my nose too.	I like it too.
He shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop, that they come from my niece, and that she’s in love with him.	He’ll think these letters are from Olivia and that she’s in love with him.
My purpose is, indeed, a horse of that color.	Yes, that’s the idea.
And your horse now would make him an ass.	He’s going to look like a total idiot.
Ass, I doubt not.	Absolutely, you idiot.
Oh, ’twill be admirable!	This is going to be great!
Sport royal, I warrant you.	It’s going to be fun, I promise.
I know my physic will work with him.	I know my medicine will work on him.
I will plant you two, and let the fool make a third, where he shall find the letter.	I’ll have you two hide—and the fool too—right where he’ll find the letter.
Observe his construction of it.	Watch his reaction.
For this night, to bed, and dream on the event.	Meanwhile, let’s go to bed and dream about this.
Farewell.	Good night.
Good night, Penthesilea.	Good night, you amazing woman, you.
Before me, she’s a good wench.	She’s a fine woman, all right.
She’s a beagle, true-bred, and one that adores me.	She’s a good little woman, and she adores me.
What o' that?	What about it?
I was adored once too.	Someone adored me once, too.
Let’s to bed, knight.	Let’s go to bed, knight.
Thou hadst need send for more money.	Tomorrow you need to get more money sent to you.
If thou hast her not i' the end, call me “Cut.”  If I do not, never trust me, take it how you will.	I know I will too, if it’s the last thing I do.
Tis too late to go to bed now.	It’s too late to go to bed now.
Give me some music.	Play me some music.
He is not here, so please your lordship, that should sing it.	Sir, the person who should sing that song isn’t here.
Who was it?	Who was it?
He is about the house.	He’s somewhere else in the house.
Thou dost speak masterly.	You’re absolutely right.
My life upon ’t, young though thou art, thine eye Hath stay’d upon some favor that it loves.	I’d bet my life that, as young as you are, you’ve fallen in love with someone.
Hath it not, boy?	Haven’t you, boy?
A little, by your favor.	A little bit.
What kind of woman is’t?	What kind of woman is she?
Of your complexion.	She’s a lot like you.
She is not worth thee, then.	She’s not good enough for you, then.
What years, i' faith?	How old is she?
About your years, my lord.	About as old as you are, my lord.
Too old by heaven.	That’s definitely too old.
Let still the woman take An elder than herself.	A woman should always pick an older man.
I think it well, my lord.	I think you’re right, sir.
Then let thy love be younger than thyself, Or thy affection cannot hold the bent.	So find someone younger to love, or you won’t be able to maintain your feelings.
For women are as roses, whose fair flower Being once displayed, doth fall that very hour.	Women are like roses: the moment their beauty is in full bloom, it’s about to decay.
And so they are.	That’s true.
Alas, that they are so, To die even when they to perfection grow!	It’s too bad their beauty fades right when it reaches perfection!
Who governs here?	Who’s the ruler here?
A noble duke, in nature As in name.	A duke who is noble in name and character.
What is his name?	What’s his name?
Orsino.	Orsino.
Orsino.	Orsino.
I have heard my father name him.	I’ve heard my father mention him.
He was a bachelor then.	When I first heard about him, he was still a bachelor.
For but a month ago I went from hence, And then ’twas fresh in murmur—as, you know, What great ones do the less will prattle of— That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.	But there was a rumor—you know, people always gossip about royalty—that he was in love with the beautiful Olivia.
What’s she?	Who’s she?
Oh, that I served that lady And might not be delivered to the world, Till I had made mine own occasion mellow, What my estate is.	I wish I could work for that lady!
Are you ready, sir?	Are you ready, sir?
No pains, sir.	No trouble, sir.
I take pleasure in singing, sir.	I like singing.
I’ll pay thy pleasure then.	Then I’ll pay you for doing what you like.
Give me now leave to leave thee.	You may leave.
Farewell.	Goodbye.
Let all the rest give place.	All the rest of you can leave too.
Once more, Cesario, Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty.	Cesario, go visit that cruel Olivia one more time.
Tell her my love, more noble than the world, Prizes not quantity of dirty lands; The parts that fortune hath bestowed upon her, Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune; But ’tis that miracle and queen of gems That nature pranks her in attracts my soul.	Tell her my love is purer than anything else in the whole world, and has nothing to do with her property.
But if she cannot love you, sir?	But if she can’t love you, sir?
I cannot be so answer’d.	I refuse to accept that.
Sooth, but you must.	But you have to.
Say that some lady, as perhaps there is, Hath for your love a great a pang of heart As you have for Olivia.	Just imagine some lady might exist who loves you as powerfully and agonizingly as you love Olivia.
Must she not then be answered?	Shouldn’t she just accept that?
There is no woman’s sides Can bide the beating of so strong a passion As love doth give my heart.	No woman is strong enough to put up with the kind of intense passion I feel.
No woman’s heart So big, to hold so much.	No woman’s heart is big enough to hold all my love.
They lack retention.	They eat too much and get indigestion and nausea.
Alas, their love may be called appetite, No motion of the liver, but the palate, That suffer surfeit, cloyment, and revolt; But mine is all as hungry as the sea, And can digest as much.	It’s as all-consuming and insatiable as the sea, and it can swallow as much as the sea can.
Make no compare Between that love a woman can bear me And that I owe Olivia.	Don’t compare a woman’s love for a man with my love for Olivia.
Ay, but I know— What dost thou know?	Yes, but I know— What do you know?
Too well what love women to men may owe.	I know a lot about the love women can feel for men.
In faith, they are as true of heart as we.	Actually, their hearts are as sensitive and loyal as ours are.
My father had a daughter loved a man As it might be, perhaps, were I a woman, I should your lordship.	My father had a daughter who loved a man in the same way that I might love you, if I were a woman.
And what’s her history?	And what’s her story?
A blank, my lord.	There was no story, my lord.
Was not this love indeed?	Doesn’t that sound like true love?
But died thy sister of her love, my boy?	But did your sister die of love?
I am all the daughters of my father’s house, And all the brothers too—and yet I know not.	I am the only daughter in my father’s family, and all the brothers too—but I’m not completely sure about that.
Sir, shall I to this lady?	Anyway, sir, should I go see the lady?
Come thy ways, Signior Fabian.	Come along with us, Signor Fabian.
Nay, I’ll come.	I’m coming, don’t worry.
If I lose a scruple of this sport, let me be boiled to death with melancholy.	If I miss this, let me be boiled alive.
Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame?	Won’t you be glad to see that rascal dog humiliated?
I would exult, man.	I’ll be thrilled.
You know, he brought me out o' favor with my lady about a bear-baiting here.	You know, he got me in trouble with the lady of the house once when I arranged a bear-baiting here.
To anger him, we’ll have the bear again, and we will fool him black and blue.	We’ll have another bear-baiting just to make him angry, and we’ll mock him till he’s black and blue.
Shall we not, Sir Andrew?	Won’t we, Sir Andrew?
An we do not, it is pity of our lives.	If we don’t, it’ll be the biggest disappointment of our lives.
Here comes the little villain.	Here comes the little villain herself.
How now, my metal of India?	How are you, my golden girl?
Get you all three into the boxtree.	Hide behind the boxwood hedge, all three of you.
Malvolio’s coming down this walk.	Malvolio’s coming down the path.
He has been yonder i' the sun practising behavior to his own shadow this half hour.	He’s been over there practicing how to act for the past half hour.
Observe him, for the love of mockery, for I know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of him.	This letter’s going to turn him into a starry-eyed idiot.
